      "descripcion": "<p>Hellpoint is a dark sci fi action RPG set in the aftermath of a massive quantum cataclysm. Every living being quickly lost their mind as their memories and bodies were merged with alternate versions of themselves from parallel universes. The accident also attracted entities of immense power that should have been left alone, in the depth of other dimensions.<br />\nYou play as a mysterious nameless character whose intentions are entirely determined by your choices. You wake up in the derelict Irid Novo space station, in orbit around a super-massive black hole.<br />\nIn the game, the space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole. Its position in the sky directly impacts the sanity of the inhabitants of the station. The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.<br />\nHellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.<br />\nIn Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.<br />\nIrid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.<br />\nHellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we&#39;ve had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.<br />\nFor centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?<br />\nHellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.<br />\nThe more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.<br />\nA terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...<br />\nEvery time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you.</p>",

It also features improved skin and sweat textures, introducing wounds, as well as flexible, varied facial animations.<br />\n[Triangle System]<br />\nFights in Dead or Alive 6 are based on a Traditional triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. When you land an attack of one type that beats another type, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, that attack becomes a Hi Counter attack and does even more damage.<br />\n[Break Actions - New Combat Mechanics]<br />\nWith this title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, making the fights more strategic than ever before. Because the actions can be performed by simply pressing the [RB] button, even beginners can enjoy the new system.<br />\n[Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks the opponent away. The first part of the move also parries attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move!<br />\n[Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output.<br />\n[Fatal Rush] Players can achieve unique combos by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. Beginners can even play by using this move exclusively, though its disadvantages will prove to be a calculated risk for more experienced players.[New Danger Zones]<br />\n[Rumble Danger] If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy.<br />\n[Mass-Destruction] If the opponent is knocked into a large stack of nearby boxes with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush”, they will plow through them all in one hit! This causes a huge burst of damage and provides an exhilarating rush.</p>",

To progress through the story, you need to search for clues, read multiple notes and solve puzzles.   <br />\nThough there are monsters in SOMA, it frightens with its atmosphere in the first place. A dark, abandoned station with dead people, uncertainty and the lack of any understanding of what is waiting for you is scarier than screamers and blood rivers.

Gathered and found objects are degrading through use, so it forces players into the constant search for better equipment. The name of the game hints at the horde mechanic, where every seventh day a large group of zombies is swarming the players&#39; location. Players will be killed in that case, unless preparations for the attack are sufficient enough. The game supports multiplayer, where other players can connect to the game server and be cooperative or hostile towards each other.</p>",

The goal is to claim a suit, pocket all of the balls, then pocket them, while denying one&#39;s opponent opportunities to do the same with their suit, and without sinking the balls early accidentally. The player wins if he pockets eight balls into a selected pocket, if the opposing player illegally pockets the eight balls, or if the opposing player knocks the eight balls off the table. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>In Hustle Kings, the player can have a face-to-face or a team match, switch four career levels, do daily tasks for additional points, and upgrade the cue and the balls. The game features a career mode as well as various trick shot and tournament modes. It also features online play which allows the player to compete against other players. Hustle Kings lets the user play their external music from the PlayStation 3 hard drive during matches. It also lets them implement the YouTube API to record video of their gameplay and upload it on the platform. The developers add rudimentary virtual reality support and Move control support so that the player could feel as if the game is performed for real. It is possible to use VR; the functions don&#39;t change much, but the player can look at balls closer than ever before.</p>",

While being not so demanding on a software side, it was released on the mobile platforms as well as on the big consoles. Such variety of platforms, however, limits the gameplay peculiarities that can be featured within a game. <br />\nThe player takes a role of one of four characters on the Belgian, American, French and German side of the Great War conflict — World War I. During the game they need to solve puzzles, watch animated cutscenes, fight enemies and do military races. <br />\nValiant Hearts is thus telling four stories simultaneously and ties them up in the end and throughout a fabula, while being historically correct when it is crucial. The game has received the Best Narrative awards and the Games for Change awards for such a plot-twists.</p>",

In a twist similar to Planet of the Apes film series, a pandemic killed most of the humans and transformed birds into sentient beings. They established a new civilization on the ruins of their human predecessors. The few remaining humans survive in the wilderness as hunters and gatherers.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player assumes the role of a teenage human girl. She is the only human student who was allowed to study at the institute run by the pigeons. She befriends several of her co-students and can become their romantic interest, despite being a member of another species.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel and therefore has minimal gameplay. The player interacts with the characters mostly by clicking on dialogue options. Some of the options require the main character to have certain stats. The game rewards multiple playthroughs by unlocking documents that reveal more of the game&#39;s world and plot.</p>\n<h3>Endings</h3>\n<p>The game has thirteen endings that depend on the choices made by the protagonist. After the player discovers the certain four endings, the Bad Boys Love mode is unlocked. This mode reinvents the plot with a horror twist. In this mode, the protagonist receives dark visions, and deeper explores the conflicted relationship between birds and humans.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>The third instalment of the fan-favorite Gundam Breaker series is on it&#39;s way! Taking a unique and meta approach towards the Gundam universe, Gundam Breaker 3 continues the formula of bringing about action-packed mecha on mecha battles that revolve around one of the core aspects of the series: Gunpla aka Gundam Model Kits! For those new to this specific spin-off, the core mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own Gundam based on the many real life parts featured in the game; the previous title, Gundam Breaker 2, included over 100 Gunpla kits to choose form, which massively increased the number of options and customizations available to a total of over 10,000,000,000 different options! Customization is a big part of the Gundam Breaker series and the upcoming release will channel that mindset by allowing players more to choose from when it comes to Gunpla colors, as well as the plating coating and dirtiness, and the expression of damage. In addition to missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, and other weapons, there is expansion equipment with various abilities that can be equipped. This will allow players to create a Full Armor Mobile Suit of their own! The SD (Super Deformed) series of Gundam will now also be available in support roles, who will take instructions from the player during battles. SD Gundams can only be set to &quot;Module,&quot; the effects of which will extend to the full team. A new &quot;Bounty Hunter Mode&quot; has been added to the series. In this mode players will be able to battle against Gunpla that have been uploaded by other players, and the victor will walk away with in-game currency.</p>",

Your protagonist, Juan Aguacate, used to be a regular farmer until one day he found a magic mask of a Luchador, that is, a Mexican wrestler. His mission is to save El Presidente&#39;s daughter who was captured by evil Carlos Calaca. The villain wants her as a sacrifice to open the gates to the World of the Dead. In a cooperative mode, Juan is aided by female luchador Tostada.</p>\n<p>Despite being a traditional Metroidvania platformer, Guacamelee! is also, surprisingly, an open-world game. You can go in any direction in this 2D world. For example, if you climb down, this counts as going south on the map. Action in Guacamelee! is inspired by fighting games like Mortal Kombat, and the controls are very responsive. The monsters are varied and very Mexican: they include traditional Dia de Los Muertos skeletons, feral armadillos, and evil cacti.</p>\n<p>The Super Turbo Championship Edition adds several new features, such as Intenso mode that makes your characters way stronger for a short amount of time. Health bars above your opponents&#39; heads are introduced. This edition also features new enemies, levels, and even a new boss in this edition.</p>",

The game revolves around slaying hordes of enemies, killing bosses, acquiring points and unlocking new abilities. There are four players to choose from Barbarian, Valkyrie, Elf, and Wizard. Each of them has the unique set of weapons and abilities. The Barbarian is the strongest melee fighter in the game; Valkyrie has a shield and spear that allow her to pierce enemies from a distance, Elf can shoot arrows and throw bomb and Wizard can combine three elements to create different spells. <br />\nThe game heavily relies on multiplayer. Up to four players can play cooperatively. Playing with other people requires coordination since some of the players’ abilities can hurt other players. Besides, all the loot and extra items in dungeons, such as food that recovers the characters’ HP, accrue to the first player that collects it. </p>\n<h3>Slayer Edition</h3>\n<p>The game was initially released only for PC. In 2015, it received an updated PlayStation 4 port with Slayer Edition subtitle. The update brought a new “Endless” game mode, new weapons and abilities, and some gameplay tweaks such as increased difficulty and replacement of the in-game shop with loadout system. The PC version also received the update.</p>",

The game, while they both are telling the story of a charming Rapture — the city descended from Orwell&#39;s and Zamyatin&#39;s pages where the society&#39;s greatest mind have suffered a severe decline.<br />\nThe central feature of the game is the unique abandoned city&#39;s aesthetics — minding the time Bioshock 2 is still a beautiful title, with detailed drawn water and strange surroundings, never mind the variety of foes.<br />\nThe remaster introduces a 4k resolution — it is now more enjoyable to explore Rapture and enjoy its various landscapes and sea-filled quarters. Among the other features: high-res textures and a set of Protector Trials,  which can give the player freakish weaponry and ammunition.</p>",

However, difficulty increases with time and death is permanent. They can choose from a number of playable characters and unlock new items and classes through various achievements. They can learn more about the lore of the game by collecting logs regarding enemies, items or locations. </p>\n<p>Unlike the first game which was a 2D sidescroller, Risk of Rain 2 is a fully 3D third-person shooter, a rarely seen transition in the last decade. The game received praise for managing to keep the same feel as the first game and taking advantage of the transition to improve it further. This sequel includes both new and returning items and playable characters, new locations and all new mechanics, such as Lunar items, special items with powerful effects and major drawbacks to counterbalance them.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, Risk of Rain 2 is still in early access.

The game is accompanied by a synthwave soundtrack recorded by several popular electronic artists including Carpenter Brut.<br />\nThe player assumes the role of the Stranger, a white-haired samurai wearing a red cloak. The Stranger was kept as a prisoner on an orbital station until he was released from his cell by an unknown benefactor wearing a bunny suit. The protagonist, now armed with a plasma gun and a katana, has to fight his way to freedom through a series of levels, each of them containing only one enemy, a boss who guards Stranger&#39;s prison. Each battle is preceded by a cutscene that further reveals the plot, and each boss requires a unique approach.<br />\nThe game is played in an isometric top-down view. The combat system is very simple, it includes no combos and consists of only four basic movements. The Stranger can slash with his sword, fire his gun, block an incoming attack or dash forward to avoid it. Each action can be made more powerful by holding its button for several seconds, although it slows down your movement.</p>",

It is the ninth title in the main Final Fantasy series and the last to debut on the original PlayStation. The game plot centers on the consequences of a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow bandit Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Alexandrian princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a gambit by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war. The plot shifts when the player learns that Brahne is a pawn of a more menacing threat, Kuja, who shares a mysterious history with Zidane spanning two worlds.<br />\nThe game was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII. Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by returning to the medieval style of the first six installments. Consequently, it was influenced heavily by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to the rest of the titles. Despite this approach, the game did introduce new features to the series, such as &quot;Active Time Event&quot; cutscenes, &quot;Mognet&quot;, and unique equipment and skill systems.<br />\nFinal Fantasy IX was released to critical acclaim. It is often cited by critics and fans as one of the best Final Fantasy titles, and holds the highest Metacritic score of the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling more than 5 million copies worldwide by March 2003 and 5.5 million copies by February 2016. It was re-released in 2010 as a PSOne Classic on the PlayStation Store; this version was compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita support arrived in 2012. In 2016, ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.</p>",

Humans only recently colonized the planet and encountered hostile alien monsters that quickly evolve. As they consume other local animals, they can mutate into new, stronger creatures.

The teams are asymmetrical: a group of four hunters opposes one monster. The hunters have to find and annihilate the monsters using their guns, jetpacks, and tracking devices. The monster&#39;s goal is to evolve. It requires him or her to prey on the smaller animals to gather experience and level up. Until the monster reaches its full power, it is very vulnerable.</p>\n<h3>Character classes</h3>\n<p>Both factions have several classes. The hunters have five characters in each of their four classes: Assault, Trapper, Support, and Medic. The monsters have five types: Goliath, Kraken, Wraith, Behemoth, and Gorgon.

      "descripcion": "<p>Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents) is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.</p>\n<p>In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as &quot;Doomguy&quot;, fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15–20 million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as &quot;WADs&quot;. As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre&#39;s boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game&#39;s release, became known simply as &quot;Doom clones&quot;. Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.</p>\n<p>The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game&#39;s source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016 and focused on returning to the fast-paced action of the first two games.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>MIND CONTROL DELETE is a standalone expansion set in the SUPERHOT universe. It’s designed as a rogue-like twist on the linear nature of the original SUPERHOT. In it’s well proven genre-defining format, SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE distills and expands on the same intoxicating rhythm of slow motion combat.<br />\nThe game will force you through dozens of increasingly difficult time-moves-only-when-you-move gameplay challenges. Each challenge will make you more powerful and bring you closer to deciphering the secrets hidden from you by the system. As you unlock powerful abilities and gain access to new playable characters, so will your enemies grow stronger, smarter and more desperate to stop you.<br />\nCome and join the fray. Play in Early Access. Let the system learn from you.SUPERHOT rogue-like expansion early access hype! What to expect now?<br />\nWe’re still a good 9-12 months away from a full release, so please don’t forget that this is nowhere close to a complete, satisfying experience just yet. The current build of MIND CONTROL DELETE is the first time we’re inviting you to check out a few of the brand new gameplay systems that are going to be central to the game:<br />\nFirst 2 playable MINDS, each with it’s own unique ability and gameplay modifiers<br />\nA kaleidoscope of the first dozen new gameplay levels that mix into the first few dozen combat challenges<br />\nNew animation and AI systems to drive new weapons, abilities, and enemy types<br />\nHitpoint system and power-up store to give you that extra oompf needed to crush your enemies and see them driven before you<br />\nProcedural rogue-like run generation baked into the core gameplay loop, enabling us to tell longer, more complex stories and deliver tons more of satisfying skill-based gameplay<br />\nBeware though - this is an extremely early, bleeding-edge version of most of those systems. The limitations for this early access build are not for the faint of heart:<br />\nNo story whatsoever - we don’t want to spoil too much too quickly so this and the next few updates will be all about gameplay features<br />\nNo advanced power-ups or new enemy types enabled yet - we want to establish and test the balance of vanilla gameplay in this build, waiting to sprinkle in gamebreaking modifiers and new foes to beat up until future updates<br />\nNo replay or point system - easy bragging about your insane skills will need to wait<br />\nAbsolutely no hidden menu minigames yet - we have so many new cool ones coming out super soon tho &lt;3<br />\nIf you’re not looking for an incomplete game that’s in constant flux and relies on your feedback and creativity to expand, or if you’d rather just play a finished experience that’s guaranteed to challenge and satisfy you and your deepest power fantasies, then we totally recommend you should wait until MIND CONTROL DELETE is out of early access.<br />\nHowever, if you’re super brave and want to help guide the development in its earliest stages, then go ahead - join us, and get your name in the credits!Why are you putting MIND CONTROL DELETE in early access in the first place tho?<br />\nWe released the original SUPERHOT in February 2016 after nearly two years of intense creative crunch. The amazing support during the development from our Kickstarter backers and the exhilarating reaction we got from you once the game released was simply mind blowing.<br />\nWith morale at an all-time high, we immediately jumped into a flurry of prototyping and refining gameplay and story concepts that we weren’t able to fit into the original game. We tested and put a bunch of them to work in virtual reality, and after releasing SUPERHOT VR to even more outstanding support from you guys, we finally had a road map for the first non-VR expansion ironed out in December 2016. In our usual no-compromise approach to design, we made that roadmap way more ambitious than originally anticipated and we decided to make the expansion a fully standalone game, allowing us to rewrite and reimagine all of our major gameplay systems.<br />\nThe single most important strength of the original SUPERHOT was the amazing involvement of tens of thousands of creative alpha and beta testers that helped us shape and balance the game and drove us to pursue zero compromises in design. After over a year of work on MIND CONTROL DELETE, we’re now ready to start this adventure together again. We’re inviting you to jump in and co-create the game with us. Talk to us, work with us, and let’s build the build the biggest SUPERHOT yet together.What’s the price tag on this? Is this that free DLC you were talking about?<br />\nYup! Way bigger than the usual free DLC though, so it&#39;ll take a bit longer to release. If you own the original SUPERHOT on Steam now or buy it while MIND CONTROL DELETE is still in Early Access, you’ll get the full expansion for free once it’s finished and released.<br />\nHowever if you can’t wait to work with us, and you feel like bravely facing rough edges and helping shape the game as it develops, then we’ll be thrilled to have you sign your name to a piece of SUPERHOT history and join us in Early Access right now.<br />\nOnce MIND CONTROL DELETE releases in earnest, it will be priced same as the other SUPERHOT games for everyone who’s still new to the franchise.FAQ<br />\nShould I buy MIND CONTROL DELETE if I haven’t played the original SUPERHOT?<br />\nNot right now. The game will be a totally standalone experience in a few updates, but the lack of clear structure and story right now would be confusing for newcomers. Definitely get the original SUPERHOT though. It’s lots of fun.<br />\nWhat’s the update roadmap?<br />\nWe’re new to Early Access, but we’re hoping to use your feedback and collaboration to drive and guide the development. We have a bunch of large features already in the pipeline that we’ll be dropping on livestream updates every few weeks, starting with the first major content update dropping in January, and following with balance and feature updates released on a monthly / bi-monthly schedule.<br />\nI really want X in the game, how do I make you want to do X too?<br />\nThe discussions around the game are taking place on Steam Community, Discord and Reddit groups. Join us, make yourself heard, and rally up your fellow players. We’ll tap into your creative hivemind. We’ll put your ideas into life.<br />\nYour mind will make the system stronger.

Carmageddon: Max Damage features a wide and varied range of cool, crazy, custom killing machines; each with its own highly distinctive “character”. Carmageddon cars are specifically built for the job in hand – wrecking opponents and killing peds! Nearly 20 years ago the original Carmageddon invented the whole concept of videogame physics and real-time damaging of cars and scenery, and so it’s obviously been our responsibility to bring this technology BANG up-to-date with a brand new state of the art car damage (and repair) system. Crush, bend, twist, and completely mangle your opponents’ and your own car – smash parts off, or split it in two; the original game was all about wrecking motors and pummelling pedestrians, and today we take this to a whole new level!  Power, Armour, and Offensive upgrades are available for your car, along with other customising options, allowing you to personalise the killing capabilities of your rides.<br />\nA host of old favourites from the original Carmageddon make a comeback, along with some all-new faces. Only ever seen before as low resolution mugshots, now you get to see them from head to toe (well, head to knees in the case of Screwie) in full HD 3D glory – usually as they smash through their windscreen and hurtle past (or INTO) yours!<br />\nThe new environments are amalgamations of the best bits from the numerous chunks of landscape that we all loved to tear around in Carmageddon. “Bleak City”, &quot;Devil&#39;s Canyon&quot;, “Dusty Trails”, “MagNuChem” and &quot;Snowy&quot; levels all return in updated forms, with their memorable landmark features such as the Loop ’de’ Loop, acid pits and Football Stadium. Everything is reassuringly surreal; hell, we’ve even managed to incorporate a giant food mixer into a level!<br />\nThe topography and detail in the locations is updated and enhanced, with even more fun stuff to smash into, smash up, snap off, and send careening into the poor pedestrian population. “Nice Shot Sir!” And talking of pedestrians…<br />\nOnce again, the game features a varied mix of adult pedestrians of all ages, shapes, persuasions and species. Classic pedestrians are back, such as old lady on a Zimmer frame and old man with his stick, with their famous cry “I was in the war!”, plus bikini babes and swimming trunk hunks, fat bastards, and herds of cows in improbable locations. Joining them are some new faces – including cyclists, wheelchair users and peds on mobility scooters. Carmageddon is an equal opportunities ped slaughterfest!<br />\nPowerUps are back and this time they’re even funnier, surrealier, hurtier, and messier than ever! Lots of the classic PUps return in super-enhanced form, such as Repulsificators, Kangaroos &amp; Solid Granites. Then we have all new PUps like &quot;Pelvic Thrust&quot; and a variety under the heading “Tossers”! Combine PUps to create hilarious combo results like Groovin’ Helium Filled Peds, or Peds without legs at a Temporary Rapture!<br />\nLeaderboards. Challenge yourself to reach the top of the leaderboard using skill or brute force!<br />\nAchievements. A suitably warped array of mad Feats and Exploits will garner you the rewards that every gamer dreams of.<br />\nChallenges: Do the most stupid things, collect meaningless trinkets and waste hours of your life in the pursuit of ultimately pointless goals!<br />\nSmelly Bushes: We’ve hidden a variety of these specially fragrant Easter Eggs throughout the game to keep you busy and entertained!<br />\nCarMODgeddon: The whole game is MODdable for your MODding pleasure!<br />\nCheck out the official Carmageddon comic series!

The main character is Edward Pierce, a troubled and alcoholic private detective. He was hired to investigate the mysterious fire that destroyed the Hawkins mansion on the Darkwater Island and killed the Hawkins family. Shortly before the fire, the mother of the family drew an image of a weird monster. Pierce&#39;s investigation eventually leads him to discover the secret cult of the ancient evil god Cthulhu, who is about to awaken to unleash his rage on Earth. The protagonist faces cosmic horrors, unholy cultists, weird dimensions, and otherworldly creatures that make him question his own sanity.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Edward Pierce and navigates him across the Darkwater Island. The goal is to investigate the case by talking to other characters, searching for clues and exploring the environment. The protagonist is weak and cannot really fight a strong opponent, so the player has to find the ways to avoid trouble. Another major concern in the game is sanity. Encountering eldritch abominations and uncovering dark secrets can drive Edward insane. His mental state affects the gameplay.</p>",

In 2007, the series moved from historical scenery to modern, got a new more advanced graphics thanks to the freshly-released consoles and presented to the players a hardcore fast-paced multiplayer. The latter is still wanted by hardcore fans, which gave the publisher Activision Blizzard a reason to remaster the game.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>In the new version, developers from the Raven Software did their best to rebuild the experience (the original game was developed by Infinity Ward). The game is available for purchase, as a separate product, and as part of a bundle. Owners of the original version of the game can get Remastered for free - you need to have the original disk for this or digital purchase. The re-released game did not change the gameplay in any way: it is still a fast-paced first-person shooter. The story campaign, during which the player takes control of several characters, also has not changed. Most of the changes turned out to be cosmetic and allowed the new studio to add new technologies to the original game: for example, while prone and moving, the weapon touching the ground will vibrate the controller. Also in the single-player campaign, new cheat codes were added, such as exaggerated physics and the ability to replace heads on the shoulders of virtual people with watermelons.</p>\n<h3>The changes</h3>\n<p>The main changes lie in multiplayer, which pulled up to the standard of modern games of the series. In place, there were the same modes, the same weapons, and perks. Added new ones, like the Prop Hunt mode, in which players turn into nonliving objects and hide on the map. New content is available as the challenges unfold.</p>",

Up to four players can compete in local multiplayer in either timed, stock or team battles. AI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all.<br />\nBrawlout’s online suite is suitably robust, with all of the following features:<br />\nA robust Ranked match system, complete with regional leaderboards<br />\n1v1 casual matches for low-stress competition<br />\n2-4 player private lobbies where players can practice or mess about to their heart’s content<br />\nThe Brawlout Network where players can check their fight stats, match history and replays<br />\nBrawlout TV which allows for live spectating and watching of specific player replays<br />\nWeekly competitive tournaments for those looking to prove their Brawlout skills<br />\nAdditional modes like the story campaign and single-player challenges are planned to be added during Early Access, along with more characters, gameplay features and other surprises!</p>",

The initial characters roster included 16 characters four of which were newcomers to the series. Since the game release, many more characters were added with DLC making roster more than twice as big as it was on launch. The core gameplay shares many similarities with Street Fighter IV. However, it abandons Focus Mode and Ultra Combos introduce in that game. The main new mechanic in Street Fighter V is V-Skills system. V-Skill is special moves, unique for every character. Using these moves helps to fill V-Gauge which can be used to perform V-Reversals, special counter-attacks, or V-Trigger especially powerful abilities that require the full gauge.</p>",

The player can select one of three airships that have different characteristics. Difficulty can also be adjusted on a scale from Rookie to Hero.</p>",

To all of you who waited patiently for the series conclusion, we deeply appreciate your patience and support. The team here at Camouflaj put our hearts and souls into this epic final episode -- we hope you agree that it was worth the wait.<br />\nJust as we did with previous episodes, Episode 5: Terminus is not just an additional chapter but it comes with thousands of fixes and enhancements. Here’s a breakdown of the major changes we made in addition to adding the fifth episode:<br />\nImproved performance, crash frequency, and optimized framerate for lower-end devices<br />\nResolved issue where Hope falls out of the game world on some machines with AMD graphics cards<br />\nFixed issues regarding Hope’s trouble retrieving the EP3 cassette at beginning of episode, near desk in Reception Area<br />\nUnity default typeface no longer appears by default in certain prefabs (English alphabet only)<br />\nImproved and revised navigation, pathfinding, and collision in Episode 1-3<br />\nImproved camera rotation limits and view in all episodes<br />\nUI and pop-up improvements in all episodes<br />\nUpdated 2D art for some scannable items in Episode 1-3<br />\nIn addition to the upgrades we’ve made, here is some of the new stuff you can expect in Episode 5 (without spoiling too much):<br />\nHostile Cameras: These new security cameras scattered throughout the game world will scan Hope and alert guards to her presence. Players can only inhabit them for a limited time, adding a neat layer of complexity to the gameplay loop.<br />\nBranching Paths: This is something we’ve kept close to the vest for a long time: EP5 has branching paths that change the course of the episode based on a decision you make early on. We don’t want to reveal too much, but this is a huge addition that greatly expands the content offered in Episode 5, offering a nice incentive to play through the campaign again.<br />\nA New Metamorphosis: Players are returning to the world of some previous episodes, but will find it looking and feeling much differently than before. You’re going to see new areas, meet new enemies, and forge some interesting alliances…<br />\nWe want to say more, but it’s better if you to experience it for yourself!<br />\nWhen you’re done with the game, I encourage you to check out our final installment of The Making of République (available now in the Deluxe Edition), and take a look back on the production of this massive, four year endeavor. We’ve prided ourselves on giving you a window into our world by providing open and honest in-game developer commentary tracks, and these video documentaries are an extension of that. You might even see some old footage from back when we were younger, healthier, and less sleepy.<br />\nFinally, we want to give a shout out to composer Zinc Lemone for his work on Episode 5’s soundtrack (also included with the Deluxe Edition.) I’ve had some standout favorite tracks in previous episodes, but EP5’s soundtrack in simply incredible from start to finish. (“Loose Change” is the <em>JAM</em> y’all.)<br />\nWatching Episode 5’s final moments come to life this past year has been bittersweet. It’s hard to believe that we are finally at the finish line after first announcing the game back in 2012. We owe a lot to our initial Kickstarter backers, our publishing friends at GungHo Online Entertainment, and our stellar voiceover cast including Rena Strober, Jennifer Hale, David Hayter, Dwight Schultz, and Khary Payton. It’s not an exaggeration to say that République is the product of thousands of people coming together and making it a reality.<br />\nThank you all, from the bottom of our hearts. It’s been an incredible journey.Camouflaj</p>",

Because these brains can exchange the necessary technology from one local scientist, who needs brains for the experiments, but the boss does not give it to him.<br />\nThe gameplay consists of destroying enemies in a variety of unexpected ways, with weapons of fourteen kinds, and among them a shotgun that turns enemies into pixel pictures and then crushes them into pixels. There are a lot of such finds in the game. In addition to shooting, there are chases and other things. And besides weapons - a lot of useful original devices.</p>",

More than a century before that, the Apophis asteroid fell on Earth, causing mass destruction and driving humanity to near-extinction. The few remaining people hide in the few safe oases, while the rest of the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland raided by gangsters and evil mutants. The main protagonist is a man named Walker, who is the last ranger of the wasteland and a wielder of superhuman powers. He fights against the totalitarian organization called The Authority.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like in the original RAGE, the sequel emphasizes its over-the-top action. The player controls Walker from the first person view and uses his huge guns and other weapons to fight monsters. The protagonist can also drive any vehicle that can be found in the game and engage in vehicular battles. When the player is driving, the game switches to the third person view. A new feature introduced in RAGE 2 is its Overdrive system that encourages aggressive playing style. By killing multiple enemies in a short amount of time, the player can enter Overdrive mode, which increases the guns&#39; power and the amount of loot. There is also a multiplayer mode.</p>",

South Park already had attempted to make quality games, but until recently they were unsuccessful. In this case, the stars converged and the game, like its predecessor, proved to be successful.</p>\n<h3>Geniuses at work</h3>\n<p>The developers themselves were the creators of the original show - Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The plot of the game is in no way connected with the previous part, except for the time when events unfold: a day after the events of the previous game. In this iteration, Cartman and the children decide to dress up as superheroes and create their mega-popular franchise, like Marvel. The player joins the action as before in the role of the The New Kid and becomes a witness in the adventures of Cartman and the team.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Gameplay-wise the game has not changed much: it&#39;s still a game similar to jRPG with step-by-step battles and a pseudo-open world, which is divided into story locations. Using a 2.5D player explores the fictional town of South Park Colorado. In the game, classes are available, and they are South Park-style satire on the classic RPG classes. The main change in the combat system is visual: now instead of a static battlefield, players and NPCs can move freely along the battlefield divided into blocks and use its features to create a tactical advantage.</p>",

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth.<br />\nAs Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.</p>\n<p>Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills.

The game consists of 6 non-related cases.<br />\nThe first accentuation in levels is made in investigating the crime scene and searching for clues.

The burden of punishment is also on the playing one, thus the game title. </p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>Three out of the six cases — The Fate of Black Peter, The Riddle on the Rails and The Abbey Grange Affair are reminiscent of the original Conan Doyle stories. Thus, the narrative flow and plot twists are adapted from the original whodunnit as well. </p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>One of the key features of the game is the possibility to guess the culprit wrong ergo making the false accusation. This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player&#39;s mistakes is insignificant.

It is designed n the vein of classic 16-bit 2D platformers.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Long ago, Dr. Wily, a would-be mad scientist, created a device called the Double Gear System that could increase the powers of robots by pushing them to the limit. The device was banned for being too dangerous for robots. This time, however, Dr. Wily decided to complete his creation and test it on the eight robots he stole from his former colleague, the wise Dr. Light. Using Double Gear, Dr. Wily creates Robot Masters of the stolen robots to help him to conquer the whole world. Mega Man, a good robot and the protagonist of the series, cannot defeat the stronger and faster Robot Masters. To help him win, Dr. Light temporarily installs him a variation of the Double Gear System.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Mega Man in a 2D environment, as he runs through the levels and defeats evil robots. There are eight unique Robot Masters that serve as the game&#39;s bosses.</p>\n<p>The Double Gear System not only sets up the game&#39;s plot but also works as a game mechanic. Using it, Mega Man can access two additional skills. The first is “Speed Gear” that allows him to slow the time down as if he moves and reacts incredibly fast. The other is “Power Gear” that allows Mega Man to make attacks that deal more damage. In accordance with the game&#39;s plot, however, the use of the Double Gear System is not safe and can overheat Mega Man.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Soulcalibur VI is the seventh major installment in its series of 3D sword fighting games. This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks. There&#39;s also a new Lethal Hit mechanic which allows the players to knock the opponent down by performing moves in the right time.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>The game includes most of the popular characters of the series, such as Mitsurugi, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Cervantes de Leon. Some of the characters are redesigned. Geralt, the famous protagonist of The Witcher series, appears as a playable guest character.</p>",

They are known only by their codenames and have different specializations: Sev is a sniper, Fixer is a technician, and Scorch is explosives expert. The player is not fully identified with the main character, and if Boss is shot down, the player can order his comrades to revive him or to continue on with the mission. The level is only considered failed if the whole Delta Squad is down.<br />\nThe plot revolves around the Clone Wars that was fought between movie Episodes II and III. The Delta Squad fights against the Separatist forces on the various planets, among them Geonosis and the Wookie homeland Kashyyk. A few classic Star Wars characters make appearances, most prominently, General Grievous as a boss and Master Yoda at a mission briefing. The game’s soundtrack contains the excerpts from the Star Wars film score, some original music, and a song by Indie Rock band Ash.</p>",

Unlike many survival games, Subnautica has a detailed plot, in which Ryley has to uncover why his ship crashed. By exploring the ocean, finding the remnants of other crashes, and listening to the radio messages, Robinson will learn about the enormous Leviathan, the mysterious Precursors, and the reason why this planet is quarantined.<br />\nThe game is famous for its spectacular portrayal of the ocean and its wildlife. Robinson is equipped with a scuba diving gear that allows the player to spend most of the game underwater, although oxygen still has to be replenished. The player can dive deep and explore the world full of corals, fish, and other colorful sea creatures, often grotesque or bio-luminescent. The environment is randomly generated to improve replayability.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a crossover platform fighting game for the Nintendo Wii published by Nintendo in 2008 and the third entry in the Super Smash Bros. series. It was developed by an ad hoc development team consisting of staff from Sora Ltd, GAME ARTS, Monolith Soft, HAL Laboratory and Paon.</p>\n<p>Like the two precedent instalments, the game features characters, locations and items from various Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda or Kirby. However, Brawl is the first game to include characters from third-party franchises, such as Sonic the Hedgehog or Solid Snake from the Metal Gear series. </p>\n<p>The Smash Bros. series is notable among fighting games for its unorthodox gameplay. A game takes place on a stage that could be compared to a platform game level. Instead of a health bar, damage is represented by a percentage. When a player hits another, the victim&#39;s percentage increases. The higher the percentage, the further a player will be knocked away when hit. The goal is to knock other players out of the screen using a varied set of moves. Two to four players can fight at the same time, either in a free-for-all match or a team battle. Special rulesets also allow for different win conditions.</p>\n<p>Items randomly appear around the stage and can be picked up and used by fighters to aid in combat. These include food that heals the user, various weapons such as laser swords or firework launchers, or even Pokéballs containing powerful Pokémon. Brawl also introduces Assist Trophies, items that allow one to summon characters from various franchises to fight for them temporarily, as well as Smash Balls, which, when broken, allow a fighter to unleash their ultimate attack on their opponents. The game also supports custom rulesets, allowing players to disable items if they wish.</p>\n<p>Brawl is the first game in the series to include a complete single-player story campaign, named the Subspace Emissary. It features all the playable characters in the midst of a conflict against a mysterious entity looking to collect pieces of their world for an unknown reason. The player fights hoards of enemies throughout a multitude of platforming levels. It was also the first game to allow online play with friends or random players. This feature is no longer available due to the discontinuation of the Wii&#39;s online service in May 2014</p>\n<p>Super Smash Bros. Brawl was praised by the critic for its fun and easy to learn gameplay, its sheer density and the attention put into the representation of its featured franchises. However, it left many fans of the series, particularly its competitive aspect, disappointed. The changes made to the gameplay from Melee considerably slowed the pace of the game and severe balance issues existed, which resulted in the game&#39;s competitive scene becoming inactive early in its life. To fix these issues, players resorted to modding. Among the various mods that were created was Project M, a mod that, at first, aimed to make Brawl feel more like its predecessor Melee, and later grew to become much more distinct from any game in the series. Project M gathered a decently sized competitive scene to the point where it was played at major tournaments along with the official games, but its development eventually shut down in 2015.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Brawl is the eight best-selling game on the Wii, having sold 13.29 million units as of March 2018. It is often considered to be the best Smash Bros. game for casual play or single-player.</p>",

It’s Rayne’s last job — will she “clean house” or find herself six feet under?<br />\nAll-new A-List voice acting: Original BloodRayne cast members Laura Bailey and Troy Baker reprise their roles as Rayne and Kagan, alongside other talented voice actors who bring new life to the original written dialog.<br />\nSharpened visuals, squashed bugs, and support for higher display resolutions (up to 4K) help make Fresh Bites the definitive Bloodrayne Betrayal experience.<br />\nNew difficulty options: Play with a newly rebalanced difficulty tuned for a fun and engaging experience, or sink your teeth into the punishing original difficulty mode if you’re looking for a tough-as-nails challenge.</p>",

In this context, the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people&#39;s consciousness, move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.<br />\nHer parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak.<br />\nThe CIA is interested in Jodie&#39;s abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.<br />\nThe game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi&#39;s forces in different ways.

      "descripcion": "<p>Battlefield V is the sixteenth game in its franchise. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Like the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player&#39;s interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.<br />\nThe game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.</p>",

Although the game is a part of the Battlefield franchise, it has no references to the previous chapters. Players are able to experience both single and multiplayer mods to get in action and to feel the era better. As a single-player campaign, Battlefield 1 offers 6 storylines (chapters) one following each other. Each consists of several missions and tells a story of a single man in the middle of a global military conflict. Playing for these soldiers and closing the targets introduces new game mechanics to players. Completing these missions gives an opportunity to dive into the history and to examine the warfare of past ages. Multiplayer experience is divided into 9 different game mods spread on 31 historical maps. You can join the dynamic battle alone or in a squad with your friends. Multiplayer allows you to assume different battlefield roles (classes) starting with a medic, support or assault and following to the tank driver, pilot and some elite units.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Assassin&#39;s Creed 2 Deluxe Edition is the second major installment of Assassin’s Creed series and the first with the main protagonist named Ezio. The first game in the series called Assassin’s Creed was praised for its mechanics and interesting setting yet it was highly criticized for being too repetitive and boring. It took 2 long years for Ubisoft to repair their mistakes and that resulted in Assassin’s Creed II. Now, the game looks a lot better not only graphical bus also gameplay-wise. It became much more interesting and epic. <br />\nAssassin’s Creed II offers a fictional history setting which as in all the others games in franchise tells a story about the never-ending war between assassins and the Knights Templars who want to control the world. The story of the game is set in modern times and it fallows Desmond Miles who once again has to go into the machine called Animus to relive his genetic memories of his ancestor who now is Ezio Auditore da Firenze.  The main story takes place in Italy during the Renaissance period in the 15th and early 16th century. Cities of Florence, Venice, Tuscany and Forli are fully explorable. Ezio fights those who betrayed his family and the player is kindly welcomed to experience this epic story as the Ezio himself.</p>",

The game starts with Mario fighting Bowser on its aircraft. Bowers knock Mario off the ship and shreds his cap into pieces. Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy. It turns out, Bowser also kidnapped Cappy’s sister Tiara, and now the heroes must chase Bowser through several kingdoms to save Peach and Tiara. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The game consists 17 levels (named as “kingdoms”). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario’s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them. Possessing enemies gives you new moves and sometimes is necessary to reach certain parts of the level.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Victor Vran is an isometric action-RPG, set in a fictional town, where the player’s character must hunt demons and other vile creatures and rid the world of darkness.</p>\n<p>The gameplay despite being similar to other games in the hack’n’slash genre features unique elements based on player’s reaction. Dodging bullets and moving around hordes of enemies can be tricky, but the game emphasizes that the main way to achieve is not just spamming two skills, but employing techniques and developing character’s abilities in the way that would be comfortable to the player. The different loot system helps the character in his journey, as various weapons have their unique abilities, and often improves character’s skills.</p>\n<p>The game’s art style is highly reminiscent of Dracula movies and other vampire-based stories. The grim locations and fearsome enemies leave a mark on any player, and the soundtrack of the game also adds to the overall mood of evil lingering in the dark.</p>",

If the level of happiness is low, the people can go to the rebels. And when the rebels accumulate a lot, they attack various objects, including the Palace. Undermining the Palace means defeat in the game, so in case of a low level of happiness, a vast army has to suppress the riots. But the military, in turn, must also be happy with life.

The player aims to explore the Ninth World, find other creatures and confront the Sorrow. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player act from the Last Castoff perspective. He has the opportunity to perform in different ways; either peacefully – making arrangements with other characters, or hostilely – fighting with enemies and using power to negotiate. The setting is performed in the isometric perspective, and every performance is supported by the theme music and dialogues between the characters. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Torment: Tides of Numenera is believed to be another game’s spiritual successor. It is called Planescape: Torment which was developed in 1999. Just like in its predecessor, Torment places emphasis on the story rather than on combat or item accumulation.</p>",

Some treasures lie almost in sight, others will have to run. Treasures can be sold, and money can be spent on bonus content. Multiplayer mode allows you to play up to 3 people at a time - this is if players follow the adventure story of the game and solve problems together. There are also battle modes, where up to 10 people can participate simultaneously. There are several combat modes, they differ in their objectives and in some ways.</p>",

You play as Garrett, the master thief who awakens after one-year slumber caused by accident in one of his missions. He finds out that his hometown is plagued by a mysterious disease “The Gloom.” <br />\nThe gameplay can be described as first-person stealth-action with the heavy emphasis on the variability of completing missions. Sneaking behind the enemies is usually a more effective way of performing tasks than openly fighting with them. Garrett possesses several different tools and weapons like lockpicks, prybar, etc. One of Garrett’s few weapons is bow which has 8 types of arrows and the full range of application from killing and poisoning enemies to putting out torches and distracting guards.</p>",

Brian Parnell, Tim Wiese (glasses) and Hung-Chien Liao.  In 2014, the friends began working after-hours on their first game. By January 2016, they had enough confidence in their progress to leave game-studio jobs in San Francisco and move to Seattle. Working in Parnell’s basement, they pursued an all-or-nothing dream to make the game of their dreams.</p>",

The licensing was provided to developers from FarSight Studios by Gottlieb, Alvin G. and Company, and Stern Pinball. In addition to a fairly straightforward development process, in parallel developers were negotiating the licensing of gaming tables. As a result, it was possible to negotiate for a certain period, and as of 2018, some types of gaming tables are not available for the game because the license was over. In total, more than sixty tables disappeared, most of which were included in paid DLCs.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game came out on all possible platforms: including the most recent ones like Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On the PC game is available for free, but for new tables, players have to pay. There is no plot in the game, and all the attention of the developers were focused on recreating all the smallest details of the gaming tables and the physics of the ball. The rest is a usual pinball: the player has access to the field and the ball, the main task is to beat out as many points as possible for three attempts, that is, without dropping the ball. You can catch it and toss it again with the help of two sticks that is the only player-controlled object in the entire playing field.</p>",

Explore the nature of good and evil, learn the true cost of power, and rise as a Mythic Hero capable of deeds beyond mortal expectations.<br />\nYour path will take you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have tried to withstand the threat coming from the portal and drive the enemy back, but to little avail. Now you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel backed by worthy paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else? Lead your army and challenge the mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will change the world – and you – forever.<br />\nCreate any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle.<br />\nEnjoy two combat modes to slay your enemies – real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly!<br />\nA cast of more than 10 unique companions is ready to join your cause. Earn their trust and respect, and they will have your back no matter what dangers lie ahead.<br />\nBut you will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of the demonic scourge. Take command of the crusaders and lead them to victory – either as a strategist controlling the battle from above, or as a field commander in a new tactical combat mode.<br />\nA gift of tremendous power has been given to you, and you must choose where this power will lead you. Take a step on one of eight Mythic Paths to obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next. Your decisions might transform you into a celestial Angel, a ravaging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, a lawful Aeon, a rebellious Azata, a wise Gold Dragon, or an ever-ravenous Swarm That Walks. The world will never be the same again.</p>",

Designed and released in 1996 by the authors of the groundbreaking game Doom - iD Software. This is the first game to start the still ongoing series. Unlike its famous predecessor, the game uses an engine capable of rendering full-fledged 3D: the game supports an earlier version of 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After moving to a new engine, the game needed a new control scheme: the movement is now possible in all three directions, including the vertical axis. This feature added to the game an additional difficulty: player have to expect the enemy attack from any direction. The game also has a full-fledged multiplayer, the previous version of which the Doom players liked.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>In a single player campaign, the player takes control of the main character named Ranger, who went to the portal in order to stop the unknown enemies, code-named Quake. The plot of the adventure consists of 32 separate levels. Six more maps are available in multiplayer for the battles between the players for deathmatch mayhem. Two mission packs were released for the game, which adds new enemies, new levels, new maps, new weapons and a new experience for players to the original game. Both packs were greatly received by both players and critics.</p>",

The order established by them is based on total control but is proclaimed as the realm of prosperity and security. However, on the periphery of large cities, there are those who consider it a dictatorship and are struggling to restore independence to people. Thus the new XCOM, the organisation of freedom fighters, is reborn. The base for the organisation&#39;s soldiers is now the alien ship &quot;The Avenger&quot;, converted to the needs of the defenders of the Earth.<br />\nThe player will have to travel around the global map, contact guerrillas in various places, look for resources and perform partisan attacks on the critical points of the enemies. The tactics of the organisation have changed - now they are in the minority. The factories for the production of weapons and other equipment were closed 20 years ago, so you have to collect any found equipment and resources.<br />\nThe game introduced many new enemies, but there are aliens from the previous game too. The hero of the game has a unique ability to be in contact with the psi-network uniting all the aliens. This ability makes him a turning point in which the enslavement of the Earth can be reversed.</p>",

Lots of different enemies always try their best to stop our adventurers from their goal. From every corner there comes danger, only briefly allowing the players to collect their thoughts and dive yet again in battle with evil.<br />\n  Following Torchlight, the second game starts with chaos erupting from underneath the world. A crazed former hero now takes the lead of hordes of different creatures, and in defeating him and his minions lies the ultimate goal of our new heroes. Take on the mantle of one of the four available classes, and be sure to utilize their might at its fullest. Stay flexible, for the treasure is always surprising, and don’t forget to use your trusty companion as the aid in battle, or as a heavy-packed war mule. Be ready for harsh defeats, or, if you feel like immortal, try the hardest difficulty for the ultimate roguelike challenge. The world of Torchlight is yours to explore!</p>",

The game was inspired by the real-life Bosnian War.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>This War of Mine is set in a fictional country Graznavia during an ethnic conflict similar to the siege of Sarajevo. The player controls a group of one to four characters caught in the middle of a war. Each protagonist has a unique set of abilities and weaknesses, some of which are hidden. Their goal is to simply stay alive. It requires them to scavenge food, meds, and other necessary supplies, keep their house warm during the winter and avoid the military. </p>\n<p>By day, the city of Pogoren is filled with snipers who shoot at everyone indiscriminately. The player can explore the city only by night, though it is not safe either, as the characters can encounter hostile looters and marauders. Survival also requires crafting new items from the scavenged junk. One of the most useful items to build is the radio that allows the player to keep track of the events outside. To win the game, the characters have to survive until peacetime which may come at random times.</p>\n<h3>Expansion features</h3>\n<p>The Little Ones expansion pack allows the player to include a child in the group of survivors. It adds a new layer of complexity to the gameplay. The child is helpless and needs an adult to take care of him or her. However, the kid can eventually learn to perform simple tasks, such as cooking. To avoid depression, the child has to assemble new toys from the junk the adults have scavenged and meet other kids to play.</p>",

Puzzles are activated at the grids you can find around locations. <br />\nThere are two modes in the game.

      "descripcion": "<p>Resident Evil Zero, known in Japan as Biohazard Zero, is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is the fifth major installment in the Resident Evil series and was originally released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2002. It is a prequel to Resident Evil (2002), covering the ordeals experienced in the Arklay Mountains by the special police force, S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team. The story follows officer Rebecca Chambers and convicted criminal Billy Coen as they explore an abandoned training facility for employees of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The gameplay is similar to early Resident Evil games, but includes a unique &quot;partner zapping&quot; system. The player controls both Rebecca and Billy, switching control between them to solve puzzles and use their unique abilities.<br />\nDevelopment for Resident Evil Zero began on the Nintendo 64 in 1998. The partner system was created to take advantage of the short load times possible with the capabilities of the N64 Game Pak. The cartridge format also provided limitations, as the storage capacity was significantly less than that of a CD-ROM. The team had to approach the design differently from previous series entries to conserve storage space. Resident Evil Zero was designed to be more difficult than previous Resident Evil games. Inspired by Sweet Home (1989), the team removed the item storage boxes present in earlier games and introduced a new item-dropping feature. Development slowed when the team encountered memory storage problems, and so production was moved to the newly announced GameCube. The game had to be rebuilt, with only the concept and story carried over.<br />\nResident Evil Zero received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the graphics and audio for building a haunting atmosphere. Opinions on the new partner and item systems were mixed. Some found the changes were an improvement and added new layers of strategy; others believed the changes were cumbersome or non-innovative. The controls were panned as outdated and Capcom was criticized for not evolving the series&#39; tank controls. The game was ported to the Wii in 2008, and a high-definition remaster was released in January 2016. These re-releases received mixed reviews due to lack of improvements made to the original. Resident Evil Zero is commercially successful, having sold over 2.5 million copies across all platforms.</p>",

Player discretion is advised.<br />\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The game focuses on exploration and builds tension slowly to create a deeper and more meaningful experience. Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways.<br />\nVisage is a first-person psychological horror game.<br />\nExplore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience.EnvironmentThe game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You’ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn&#39;t even bear imagining.<br />\nStorylineThis house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You’ll soon wish you could join the dead&#39;s ranks in their abyss, but death won&#39;t help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?<br />\nDark entitiesThe families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They’ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own.<br />\nGameplayIn Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You’ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it.<br />\nDying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you&#39;ll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.</p>",

Balduq is known as &#39;the prison city&#39; for its large prison facility inside the town and its architecture featuring high walls as a result of being built upon the fortified era. Furthermore the city is an important nexus for transportation in the region resulting in a wide range of inns, bars and trade centers. In more recent years public facilities such as theaters and baths are starting to be developed too.</p>\n<p>In more recent years rumours of beings called &quot;Monstrum&quot; are said to have started appearing creating a huge fuss with its residents. The Monstrum are said to possess unique supernatural abilities, some of them seem to be helping the poor and helpless, others are outlaws up to no good. This dichotomy results in the villagers becoming scared/wary of them.</p>\n<p>Balduq Prison, located at the edge of the city, supposedly is the largest prison facility of the Romun empire. Originally it was a fortress built to protect the Romun border, it is more recently that it has been repurposed as a prison facility. Featuring only one entrance through a drawbridge and surrounded by steep rock walls and deep moats it is said to be inescapable. The townsfolk does not hold the prison facility in high regard as the facility also is used to detain critics of the empire as does it detain political prisoners.</p>\n<p>Source: https://isu.fandom.com/</p>",

First, there&#39;s Dux, the duck-headed wise-cracking mutant with an attitude. Then there&#39;s Bormin, a huge gruff pig that has anger issues. Their third companion is Selma, a seemingly human female who has protective stone skin.

To become certified Furniture Arrangement &amp; Relocation Technician (F.A.R.T.), employees need to pop the training tape into the VCR and take in the dos and don’ts of moving furniture.<br />\nTrain alone or with friends in this action, puzzle, physics based moving simulator. Expect plot twists, irreverent humor, cameos and borderline trademark infringing scenarios as you complete the 50+ levels. With party mode you&#39;ll be able to compete for the highest score locally or against the community.<br />\nGuided by narrator Mick “RicePirate” Lauer players will learn the ropes in a series of increasingly precarious and fantastical instructional lessons. These span everything from unloading cargo off moving planes to smuggling giraffes out of the zoo and transporting goods to strange locales like haunted houses and outer space.<br />\nNo matter what the job entails, customers appreciate prompt delivery. So, whether on a heist or doing a repo job, load as much into the truck as possible before zooming off to the next gig. How freight gets from one place to another is entirely up to players, though, so toss the manual out the window and get creative. Break down the walls, throw things, and use technology like portals and ray guns across more than 50 levels. Anything goes, as long as the work gets done!<br />\nEnjoy the game solo as an independent contractor or team up with a friend or loved one. Moving Out features both local and online play across its arcade, story, and versus modes. Each level also adjusts the experience dynamically to account for the number of players on screen, thereby welcoming Smooth Move employees of all ages and skill levels.<br />\nMoving Out is currently in development as the premiere title from SMG’s Melbourne studio and is made in collaboration with Stockholm-based developer Devm Games.</p>",

The story takes place in the city of Glass that is ruled by mega-corporations. Faith, the protagonist of the original game, returns in Catalyst.

The player controls Faith from the first person view as she runs and leaps across the rooftops of Glass. Puzzle-like level design requires her to use pipes, wires, and ledges to get to her destination. Precision timing is important to perform jumps, slides, and rushes in a seamless flow.</p>\n<p>The combat system in Catalyst changed dramatically. Unlike in the original game, Faith cannot use guns. She can fight in hand-to-hand combat but usually has to avoid enemies.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>Like its predecessor, Catalyst is notable for its minimalist use of colors. Glass is mostly shining white and dark blue, while the occasional use of other colors signifies something important. The game is accompanied by the cold, atmospheric electronic soundtrack by Solar Fields.</p>",

A virus attack led to a machine uprising, and Mighty No. 9 is among the few robots that were not infected. His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason. He will also assimilate their data to send it back to the lab so that Dr. White could find the cure for the virus. Beck is occasionally assisted by Call, a female robot unaffected by the virus.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Beck in a 2D environment. Like in Mega Man, the protagonist jumps platforms and fires a gun. Beck can also use the special acceleration ability that allows him to leap long distances and through his enemies. By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up. The type of a power-up depends on the color of a Xel: red gives Beck more powerful attacks, green speeds him up, yellow improves his stamina, and blue heals him. Gathering Xel from Mighty Numbers, Beck receives new special abilities.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game includes a cooperative multiplayer for two, in which the second player controls Call. Her gameplay is very different and is largely defensive as she uses deflector shields to protect herself and Beck.</p>",

This system provides a change in the world of the game and its inhabitants from the actions of the player. Therefore, each passage differs from other passages. For the game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Nemesis system has been improved.</p>\n<p>If the player has the game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, he can transfer to Middle-earth: Shadow of War some characters from the previous game - one enemy and one ally.</p>\n<p>The player controls Talion.

The game is the sequel to Metro: Last Light and is set two years after its ending.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Exodus takes place in the year 2036 in post-apocalyptic Russia. According to the Metro universe backstory, in 2013 the planet was devastated by a total nuclear war. The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth&#39;s surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound. The last remnants of humanity survive by hiding in the subway tunnels (hence the name of the series). The main protagonist is Artyom, a former dweller of Moscow Metro. Together with his wife Anna, he escaped the capital to search for survivors in the Russian Far East (thus making the “Redemption” ending of the Last Light the series&#39; canon). </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Artyom from the first person view. Exodus introduces the sandbox open-world, although the game combines it with the traditional linear levels. Unlike in previous games, Exodus is set mostly outside the subway system. Thus, the game also introduces the weather, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons. The player explores the Russian wilderness during and after the nuclear winter and rides a steam locomotive named Aurora through Siberia.</p>",

All the traditional victory types are in place, and a new one, religious, is introduced.</p>\n<p>A distinct new feature in the sixth part is that city improvements are no more concentrated in each city&#39;s only main tile. Instead, they are distributed throughout its whole surrounding area. Each of them is now considered a &quot;district&quot; with a specific purpose, and some of them should be built only on specific terrain. Similarly, wonders now occupy tiles on their own. Technology tree was also modified to take into account the player&#39;s terrain improvements that may speed up the research of certain technologies. Cultural achievements, such as Opera or Drama, are no more considered &quot;technologies&quot; and form a separate Civics research tree instead. Also, unlike most of its predecessors, Civilization VI allows stacking similar types of military units.</p>",

His goal is to avenge the death of his father. Hazuki follows the murderer, Lan Di, to the mountainous region in China called Guilin.

They face not only Lan Di but also a new villain named Niao Sun. While the game is set outside Japan, Hazuki can stay in touch with his friends back home by calling them on the phone.</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>The game spent more than ten years in development due to high costs of the original two games (the first Shenmue was the most expensive game ever at the time of its release). Shenmue III only came to be made because of a crowdfunding campaign. This is not the final part of the story, according to the series&#39; creator Yu Suzuki, who is planning more Shenmue games.</p>",

The ship gets attacked by brigands that slay the whole crew and later gets destroyed by sea giant Kraekan resulting protagonist to find himself on a mysterious island. The hero must now find a way from the island and save lost princess. <br />\nThe game is notable for its hand-drawn watercolor art style with the dark and cold palette. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay is heavily inspired by From Software’s Souls series and Castlevania franchise. The game mixes traditional Metroidvania-style exploration with several game mechanics borrowed from Dark Souls. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of eight classes. The class affects initial equipment of the character and his starting skills. It does not, however, affect character’s stats or restrict him from acquiring any skills from the Skill Tree later in the game. <br />\nThe combat relies on different types of attacks, dodging, blocking and use of various abilities and items. There are more than 600 weapons, pieces of armor, disposable items and other equipment that can be found throughout the game. <br />\nThe game features local multiplayer, both cooperative and competitive.</p>",

This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.</p>\n<p>Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew.

The game is set in the Onion Kingdom that was attacked by an insatiable spaghetti monster. The chefs travel back in time to refine their cooking skills and feed the monster when it appears again.<br />\nSince even in the single mode the player has to control two cooks, the game predictably has a co-op multiplayer and a competitive mode in which the players try to “outcook” each other. Both modes, however, are local, and there’s no online multiplayer.</p>",

Players are offered to take control of Abe on his way to the liberation of the rest of enslaved Mudokons. The gameplay features classic platformers’ mechanics: all the action is divided into 2D levels that should be passed. In the course of the completion, Abe is going to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and defeat (or dodge) enemies. Each players’ mistake from failing a grenade throw to falling from high ground will cause death and a restart of the level from the last checkpoint, which means difficulties. On the way through the Oddworld Abe can use his supernatural ability to telepathically influence Sligs (unplayable characters). However, their help is only available in safe areas, so the Mudokons’ rescue is though up to Abe.</p>",

It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in October 2004, and for the Nintendo GameCube in March 2005. Mortal Kombat: Deception follows the storyline from the fifth installment, Deadly Alliance. Its story centers on the revival of the Dragon King Onaga, who attempts to conquer the realms featured in the series after defeating the sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung, the main antagonists in the previous game, and the Thunder God Raiden, defender of Earthrealm. The surviving warriors from the previous titles join forces to confront Onaga.<br />\nTwenty-six characters are available to play in the game, with nine making their first appearance in the series. Deception contains several new features in the series, such as chess and puzzle games with the MK characters and an online mode. The Konquest Mode returns from Deadly Alliance, but follows the life of Shujinko, a warrior who is deceived by Onaga to search for artifacts to give Onaga more powers. In November 2006, Midway released Mortal Kombat: Unchained, a port for the PlayStation Portable, which adds characters to the game from the previous title.<br />\nSeries co-creator Ed Boon designed Deception to be an unpredictable fighting game, and included new features such as the minigames as surprises. Several parts from Deadly Alliance such as combos and arenas were redesigned to be more realistic as well as more interactive. Deception has been well received by video game reviewers, who praised the fights and the new features. The Konquest Mode, however, received criticism for poor voice acting. Several publications have called Deception the best fighting game of 2004.</p>",

The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist, both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There&#39;s also the frame story set in the contemporary age.

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!<br />\nDinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br />\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br />\nBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br />\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br />\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br />\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!<br />\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you&#39;ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br />\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br />\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br />\nOn the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK&#39;s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique &#39;Procedurally Generated ARKs&#39;, for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br />\nYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!<br />\nThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

Their famous protagonists fight each other on an arena. In accordance with its name, the game is the “ultimate” installment of the series, in that it offers the players all the characters ever featured in Super Smash Bros. The game also introduces five new characters, most famously, Castlevania&#39;s Simon Belmont.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike most fighting games, Super Smash Bros. series is built around knocking opponents out of the arena rather than lowering their health bars. However, the damage meter increases the character&#39;s chances to be knocked out. Each fighter has a limited number of lives and loses one when he or she is knocked out. The player is eliminated when he or she loses all lives.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate includes several competitive multiplayer modes. Besides the traditional versus mode, there are several new modes not featured in the previous games. These include Tournament (the playoff mode for 32 players), Smash Squad (team multiplayer), Smashdown (a mode in which the defeated characters are eliminated).</p>",

The player assumes the role of US special forces operative Karl Fairburne. His task is to eliminate the Nazi German general Franz Vahlen before he completes his project of a doomsday weapon. The locations and background events are inspired by the real historical places and battles.<br />\nThe gameplay is strongly oriented towards stealth action. Your protagonist is a talented marksman who can use a variety of sniper rifles. Finding a perfect spot to snipe from is as important as changing it, since you cannot hold one position for too long without being detected. Fairburne’s condition and the environment influence his accuracy; for example, he cannot shoot straight after running or against the wind. A unique targeting system allows you to see where your bullet will hit the enemy’s body or a vehicle and the amount of damage it can deal. Fairburne can also use other types of guns, as well as explosives. Kills earn the player the points that push your character towards higher ranks. Besides the story mode, there’s a co-op mode and five multiplayer modes, including the classic deathmatch and “capture the flag”.</p>",

The city itself consists of three zones: The City, The University, and the Industrial Area. Each zone has its own differences, for example, there are a lot of monuments and concrete buildings in The City, while The University boasts a high number of open spaces.</p>\n<p>Like in previous installments, the game&#39;s core mechanic called Flick It is still present in the game and is essential for getting high scores. It gives the player control of the skater and maps it to the right stick of the gamepad. Players are given points for doing tricks. The amount of points depends on the difficulty of the trick and their combos. </p>\n<p>The game offers three difficulty settings: Easy (you can jump higher and do tricks faster), Normal (a classic difficulty, like in previous games of the series), and Hardcore (the physics resembles the same of the real world). </p>\n<p>There is an in-depth tutorial called Skate.school that is accessible at any point in the game.</p>",

The world is entirely free to explore. Throughout it, you come across survivor’s bases that you can upgrade with different facilities such as kitchens, gardens, workshops and many more. During the game you are also going to meet new survivors, that would join you and become playable. Each survivor has its progression system with numerous stats to upgrade and abilities to unlock. The death in the game is permanent for every survivor. The game offers many unique items and weapons, both ranged and melee, to fight zombies and hostile survivors. The ammunition for firearms is limited therefore frequently it’s better for players to avoid combat and use stealth and distraction items rather than brute force. One of the game’s most notable features is the full-fledged cooperative multiplayer support that allows groups of up to four players to go through the entire game.</p>",

Another surge damages the crew’s helicopter; Nathaniel is the only person who stays alive. He fades out to find himself in the past. At this point, the plot twists; every event in the past has an impact on the present. Back in 1955, Nathaniel meets Nikolai Demichev, a Soviet scientist working at Katorga-12.

After merging with Ultor Corporation after the events of the second game, Boss and his lieutenants became a corporation of their own. And now, after a run-in with the corrupt police forces, when they’re in the hands of the Syndicate, alone and cut out from the gathered wealth and support, 3rd Street Saints have to start from the bottom. <br />\nWhile being a third person action adventure game, Saints Row: the Third is described by developers as the game that has everything in it. While the base game is reminiscent of GTA type of games mechanically, shifting tone and frantic story create the comedic and exciting atmosphere. A long line of DLC adding to the game not only unique missions, even by the Saints Row standards, but customization items, transport, and outfits. Reviews adore the lack of serious tone and gritty realism.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Sacred 3 is a hack’n’slash game, a third installment in the series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game starts with a brief introduction to the fantasy world of Ancaria. The realm prospered for a long time, until the ruler of the Ashen Kingdom struck a deal with demons, and invaded his neighbors. The player must take action as one of the six playable characters, each with different classes and abilities, and save the world.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The third game of the series has shifted from being an RPG diablo-like game to an arcade slasher, removing skill trees and development, while adding even more enemies, dynamic action and refined physics. Each level in the campaign shares similarities with one another, as the objectives are simple: defeat enemies, reach the checkpoint, defeat the boss and unlock the next level.</p>\n<h3>Graphics and other features</h3>\n<p>The game is rich with fantasy characters, colorful landscapes and well-designed enemies. The special effects in battle provide the player with an arcade touch: blood splatters from every foe, mysterious explosions occur to left and right, ground quakes from fearsome bosses.  The game features a 4-player cooperative mode, where players take up arms as different heroes and join in battles against hordes of enemies.</p>",

It is a top-secret organization named Third Echelon. The agency has access to cutting-edge surveillance and military technologies. Third Echelon&#39;s agents are free to violate any law as long as it is required to complete the mission successfully.</p>\n<p>In 2004, contact is lost with a CIA agent. Homeland security sends a second agent to check on the CIA&#39;s asset, yet contact is lost again. Third Echelon sends Sam Fischer to investigate the situation.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s main focus is to hide from the enemy instead of going loud and gun-blazing. The players have to leave no trace of themselves. It is essential to stick to the shadows, use the environment for cover and carefully pick your equipment to avoid detection.</p>\n<p>Shadows are the best friend of the player. A special indicator is present on an in-game HUD that shows if the players are visible to their enemies. The game does not welcome the usage of weapons as the sound of gunfire is very loud and can be heard from the distance. The players have to rely on headshots, as they don&#39;t have much ammo on them. Sam has multiple advanced gadgets to aid him in his mission as well as a lot of hand-to-hand combat experience.</p>",

Excellent reviews and 92/100 score on Metacritic is a serious indicator. In the Steam community, there are still enthusiastic nostalgic reviews of almost everything that concerns Tom Clancy&#39;s Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. And there is an explanation for this. The game was released in 2005 and became the third in the Splinter Cell series. Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal was engaged in the development, who is also responsible for Assassin&#39;s Creed and Far Cry. Critics and player noted the Xbox and PC versions of the game as the best. </p>\n<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>In Tom Clancy&#39;s Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the player will feel like a professional spy, NSA agent Sam Fisher from a special unit called “The Third Echelon.” The plot takes its origin from the first game in the series. However, the narrative is constructed in such a way that the player does not necessarily have to go through it in order to enjoy the story. The events of the game occur in different parts of the Earth that are based on places from the real world. At the heart of the game is the conflict unfolding between China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan.</p>\n<p>In addition to a single user campaign, there is the possibility of playing on the net. However, the official online services for this game were disabled as early as August 2016. Despite this, players still have the opportunity to play on the local network or, with due skill - through third-party services.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<h3>The role model</h3>\n<p>Released in 2008, the game, is similar to another well-known representative of the genre of action-role-playing games God of War series. Developers became studio Liquid Entertainment, and the publisher company Codemasters. The game appeared on the PC and on the most popular consoles of its generation: Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>\n<h3>The story and the setting</h3>\n<p>The plot of the game tells about Jason, and the action takes place in Ancient Greece. Like God of War, the game uses ancient Greek mythology to build a game universe. The modified myth of Jason and the Argonauts, who went on a journey for the Golden Fleece was used as inspiration. According to the scriptwriters of the game, Jason is a Greek king, whose wife was killed in front of him. The only way for a grieving husband to return the beloved is the Golden Fleece, which can resurrect the dead. Other well-known heroes of myths appear in the game: Hercules, Achilles, Medea, Medusa, Patroclus, and others. Together they travel through a variety of real and imaginary locations: Iolcu, Delphi, Mycenae, Tartar, and Kifr.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game consists of a large number of dialogues and enemies confrontations on vast, detailed levels. In contrast to God of War, critics point out simple battles with bosses and the strange arrangement of enemies on each level, which also simplifies the gameplay. You can use a sword as a weapon, a spear, and a mace is also available. Each weapon has its own characteristics and offers different gameplay: the mace breaks shields, but can not cope with a large number of enemies, the sword reduces the player&#39;s defense capabilities, but increases the effectiveness of melee combat, etc. In addition to these weapons, you can upgrade Jason skills on four branches: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. Points for upgrades the player receives as the tasks are completed and for the correct answers in the dialogs.</p>",

One of the title&#39;s main attractions is the auteur game design by Shinji Mikami who inspired both games of the series.<br />\nHis style mixes absurdist plots, dark, horror movie-like environments, and almost absent jumpscares. The player must explore the vast maps in search of clues, collectibles, and story-related events. The game is highly non-linear and allows completing mandatory missions whenever one likes it. The time between the quests may be spent on crafting materials out of available resources, completing side quests and develop Sebastian Castellanos&#39; — the protagonist&#39;s — abilities. There is a total of five skill trees each corresponding to playstyle and physical characteristics.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game follows a story of a haunted mental hospital which was the setting for the first part of the series. The narrative circles around the presumable death of the policeman&#39;s daughter and the opportunities that she is not dead yet. Mental illnesses of his wife — Myra accompanies the protagonist&#39;s on his way through the story. The game does not feature various endings — no matter how one tries to alter the storyline, it does not affect the outcome of the ending.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president&#39;s daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.<br />\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.<br />\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.</p>\n<h1>Gameplay</h1>\n<p>The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series&#39; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.<br />\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a &quot;finishing move&quot; on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#39;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.<br />\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.<br />\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br />\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong&#39;s involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series&#39; villain Albert Wesker. &quot;Ada&#39;s Report&quot;, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada&#39;s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames &quot;The Mercenaries&quot; and &quot;Assignment Ada&quot; (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.</p>\n<h1>Plot</h1>\n<p>U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#39;s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.<br />\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.<br />\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.<br />\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is the latest installment in the Resident Evil series. For 13 long years, Resident Evil series were rejecting the survival-horror aspect and atmosphere of first original games in the series mainly released in nineties on PlayStation one system. From the famous Resident Evil 4 until Resident Evil 6, the series went full-force into action genre leaving horror elements behind and hard-core fans disappointed. Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest. First of all, the camera angle changed from over the shoulder view into first-person mode. Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens. The player controls Ethan Winters who is searching for his lost wife in a dark mansion filled with horrible creatures and insane family. <br />\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard can also be played with virtual reality setup and it’s known as one of the best games which supports VR.</p>",

You play as a Marine Corporal Matthew Kane, a member of elite Rhino Squad. The squad participates in the invasion on Strogg&#39;s home planet, but their spacecraft gets crushed in the middle of the battle zone. Now the protagonist must reunite with his team and finish the mission.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay shares many similarities with previous entries in the series, however this time, the game is much more single-player focused. The single-player mostly consists of fighting with aliens in different locations on foot with occasional differences such as turret sections or mech missions. One of the most notable differences in the game comparing to the rest of the series is that most of the time you are accompanied by the squadmates that help you fight enemies. The player has 12 weapons to choose from, most of which are recurring from the previous games such as nailgun, shotgun, railgun, blaster.<br />\nThe multiplayer includes six different game modes: Deathmatch, Tourney, Capture the Flag, Arena Capture the Flag and DeadZone.</p>",

The publisher was Activision, and the game was released on April 24, 2012, on PS3 and Xbox 360, and then, on July 24, 2012, on PC. Later, in August 2015, it was released on consoles of the next generation - PS4 and Xbox One.</p>\n<h3>The setting</h3>\n<p>The action takes place in a city called New York Zero, where an epidemic is raging, and its territory is divided into zones. The player will try on the role of Sergeant James Heller, who serves in the Middle East. It all begins at the moment when his wife calls and says that the epidemic has begun again in the city and they are at the epicenter with their daughter. Returning home, James discovers that his family is dead and now his task is to find someone who, in his opinion, is the culprit of these deaths.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Cruel and bloody Prototype 2 is the second game of the series. It seems that, compared to the first part, the gory feel is becoming bigger. The game is allowing you to run and jump almost anywhere and do whatever the player wants - anarchy! But despite the fact that the game takes place in an open world, a player can feel some linearity of events. According to lead designer Matt Armstrong, this was done purposefully so that the player would feel the development of the storyline and wouldn’t be afraid of too many options, and have the opportunity to open new territories gradually, thereby more effectively upgrading his character and immerse in the game’s universe.</p>",

The townspeople are struck by a mutation that turns people into bloodthirsty monsters.</p>\n<p>The protagonist of the game is a seemingly unremarkable young man named Alex Mercer. At the beginning of the game, we know little about him, but it&#39;s still more than he knows about himself - Alex does not remember anything, does not even know that he has super abilities.</p>\n<p>Abilities are very useful to him, because he will have to stop the epidemic and at the same time hide from the army, police and mercenaries.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Alex comes to the senses in Ghentec&#39;s morgue, located in its Manhattan headquarters. Apparently, the reason for his awakening was the noise produced by mercenaries of the organization Blackwatch, trying to break open the doors of this headquarters.</p>\n<p>Alex tries to hide, run away. The mercenaries try to stop him, but Alex discovers in himself one by one amazing abilities - he is not harmed by bullets, he can jump high, throw heavy objects, run on the walls of buildings. And he can &quot;absorb&quot; people, taking their appearance and gaining knowledge about everything that the absorbed people know and remember. For example, after the takeover of one of the commanders of Blackwatch, Alex finds out that he has a sister.</p>\n<p>Alex finds his sister and learns from her (this time without absorption) that he was an important employee of the company, at the headquarters of which we met him at the beginning of the game. Alex&#39;s job duties included working with biological weapons.</p>\n<p>During the game, the army and the police consider Alex guilty of creating and spreading the virus, Blackwatch pursues Alex for other reasons, and Alex himself tries to stop the mutants and other opponents with all the power of their super abilities. Soon it turns out that among these superpowers there is the ability to turn his body into almost anything, including weapons, shield and armor.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>All of Manhattan from the very beginning of the game is open for the game. Outside of Manhattan, however, you can not get out. The player can follow the story, and can perform separate missions. Due to the presence of super abilities, the hero can move both horizontally and on walls. But not as an insect, but just running. Falling from the height does not hurt Alex, so he can use this trick to defeat opponents - literally falling on their heads.<br />\n<br />\nAlex can jump very high, and manage to plan in the air.</p>\n<p>Alex fights, using the ability of his body to transform. His hands can turn into sledgehammers, blades, whips or shields. He can instantly increase the volume of his body&#39;s muscles to increase their strength - in normal mode, such a mass would have prevented him, so he does not wear all these muscles all the time. His skin can be turned into armor. He can also see in the dark and distinguish mutants from normal people by eyes.</p>\n<p>All abilities can also be improved as you progress in the game and perform various tasks.</p>\n<p>In addition to the super powers of the body, the hero uses assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, captures infantry combat vehicles, tanks, helicopters and uses their weapons.</p>",

You find yourself stranded on the Talos I space station, invaded by hostile aliens referred to as the Typhon. To survive, you must explore Talos I in search of weapons and resources to fight off the invaders. Along the way, you&#39;ll use neural modification devices to learn skills and psychic abilites.</p>\n<p>Prey&#39;s gameplay loop takes heavy inspiration from System Shock and Bioshock. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay and its atmosphere. Prey received one paid DLC extension called Mooncrash which introduced a roguelite mode and a free update called Typhon Hunter which introduced a multiplayer mode inspired by classic prop hunt.</p>",

To achieve that goal, you may choose one of the two available campaigns: will you become an Adventurer or a Trader?<br />\nIf you chose the way of the Adventurer, lead an unforgiving campaign for the conquest of the seas: invasion, piracy, bounty hunting, raiding; do whatever it takes to build your own empire in the Caribbean.

The squad of criminals searching for another “big score” is set up against easy-to-manipulate civilians and powerful police forces, so players are to try their best to prevent the alarm signals and not to face armed resistance.

      "descripcion": "<p>This sequel to the comic dark fantasy Overlord allows the player to have fun being evil. You play as the dark Overlord who leads his armies of minions against the human Glorious Empire (which obviously mimics the real-world Roman Empire). The Glorious Empire is not &quot;good&quot; anyway: its leaders are trying to eliminate all magic users, so the &quot;evil&quot; motivation is quite justified. However, to accomplish his conquest and become a truly powerful and feared dark lord, you will have to commit some really vile deeds. One of your first missions, for example, involves slaughtering baby seals.<br />\nThe game follows the Overlord from his childhood, as he grows from a nasty kid to a mighty dark knight that looks a lot like Sauron as shown in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. The Overlord begins his conquest with a pack of goblins and a single troll, but over time his minions will develop into more powerful and deadly creatures and attack the enemy in large hordes. The game does not turn into a strategy, however, as you still only directly control the dark lord himself, and the minions are commanded through his orders.  Overlord II is famous for its humor: the game does not take itself too seriously. There are all sorts of puns and parodies on the stereotypical villains and other fantasy tropes, such as elves and fairies. Goblin minions squeak, cringe and fall, while playful Danny-Elfman-esque music is echoing in the background.</p>",

The game is set on Skira, a fictional Northern Pacific island with huge oil reserves. China annexed the island, provoking a military conflict with Russia and the US. Skira’s landscape is thoroughly modeled after a real-life Kiska island in Russia. <br />\nThe player assumes the role of a leader in a squad of four US soldiers, three of which are AI-controlled. In the single-player campaign, they perform a series of military operations against the Chinese army. The gameplay tries to authentically simulate the real warfare, with no checkpoints and few scripted scenes. Depending on the difficulty level, the player may even lack the traditional HUD indications of health, ammo, and directions. The player will have to march long distances through the 35 km wide Skira, which may feel like a slog, but also adds to the game’s realism.<br />\nThere are many multiplayer modes in Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. The players can assume the roles of the remaining three soldiers to play through the main campaign. There&#39;s also a local PvP mode and a couple of traditional online multiplayer modes.</p>",

However, Shift automatically adjusts the difficulty depending on the player&#39;s experience and skills. Before the player enters the career, he or she has to complete a test drive at the famous Brands Hatch track to familiarize the game with his or her driving abilities. </p>\n<h3>Cars</h3>\n<p>Need for Speed: Shift offers a roster of more than 60 vehicles. As in most Need for Speed games, the player starts with a small amount of money and only a handful of available vehicles. To unlock and purchase better cars, the player has to win races. The cars in Need for Speed: Shift consists of four classes called &quot;tiers&quot;. The lowest tier contains the cheapest and slowest cars, while supercars from manufacturers like Lamborghini and Bugatti belong to the higher tiers. </p>\n<p>The game also has a detailed modification system. The player can customize not only the car&#39;s look but also its important details like tires and aerodynamics.</p>\n<h3>Tracks</h3>\n<p>As the player progresses, he or she may unlock new levels. Some of them are based on real-life tracks of Formula One fame, including Spa-Francorchamps, Nurburgring, Silverstone and Laguna Seca. Others are purely fictional and only exist in-game.</p>",

However, the car may be destroyed in Highway Battle — one of the game mods. <br />\nThe title features some RPG elements — wheelman points, which grants the player access to bonus levels and car parts. <br />\nThe police in the game are traced by the bar at the top of the screen varying between Busted and Evade modes. The capturing of the player results in the checkpoint restart.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s title suggests the protagonist role in the story — he is an undercover police agent given a task to infiltrate the group of street-racers to expose them to arrest. The background behind the races is taking down the criminal gangs and cliques. During the narrative player is faced with some dilemmas demanding a hard choice of him on which side to take.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Need for Speed: Underground 2 is a cross-platform racing video game and the eighth installment in the popular Need for Speed driving game series published and developed by Electronic Arts. Released in 2004, it is the direct sequel to Need for Speed: Underground, and is part of the Need for Speed series, available on Microsoft Windows, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and mobile phones. Like its predecessor, it was also commercially successful, breaking sales records in the United Kingdom.<br />\nThe game entails tuning cars for street races, resuming the Need for Speed: Underground storyline. Need for Speed: Underground 2 provides several new features, such as a broader customization, new methods of selecting races, the &quot;explore&quot; mode (similar to the Midnight Club series, in a large city known as &quot;Bayview&quot;). The City Center was based on Philadelphia, Beacon Hill was based on Beverly Hills and Coal Harbor was based on Camden, New Jersey, and Bayview as a whole is a microcosm of the west coast of the United States. Underground 2 also introduces several SUVs, which could be customized as extensively as other Underground 2 vehicles and used to race against other SUV racers. Brooke Burke is the voice of Rachel Teller, the person who guides the player throughout the game.<br />\nThe game has been ported to PlayStation Portable, under the title of Need for Speed: Underground Rivals. The Nintendo DS port introduces a new feature in which the player is able to design custom decals to adorn any vehicle in the game.</p>",

The game is set in a fictional city named Fortune Valley. The player can choose between the three individuals to represent. The title features a real car — a total of 74 ones, and crafting system — many car parts can be tuned according to the player&#39;s liking. <br />\nThere is a total of five challenges types: Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag, and Runner. All the modes share the goal — to reach the finish. However, the initial purpose is altered depending on the race — sometimes one has to drift his way to the finish line, somewhere the manual transmission turns one, and the gear switching comes to be mandatory.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Payback is one of few NFS&#39; to feature ongoing narrative — the story of this one emphasizes the revenge theme. Three characters — Tyler, Mac, and Jess — are trying to avenge Lina who betrayed the crew from the very start.  Each member of the gang has its unique abilities — Jess, for instance, is professional intel gatherer, so she plays a role of inside agent all the time. Guys, on the other hand, are more into races, so they do the dirty job in the trio.</p>",

There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.<br />\nMinecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture.

It is the thirteenth game in the Medal of Honor franchise, but in comparison to the previous ones, its plot is unique. The game is set in the historical period of the War in Afghanistan. The single campaign opens up in 2001 during the invasion of Afghanistan. The action gives an opportunity to participate in the military conflict for the U.S. Navy. In the course of the storyline, players alternate between the roles of a Navy SEAL operator codenamed Rabbit, Delta Force sniper Deuce, U.S. Army Ranger specialist Dante Adams, and AH-64 Apache gunner Hawk. The gameplay is based on typical military operations including the completion of in-game objectives (raiding enemies’ checkpoints and rescuing hostages). Medal of Honor multiplayer offers a choice of joining one of the conflict’s forces: the Coalition or the Opposing Forces. Each side has its own weapons, however, comparable in general stats. To start a match, the player should choose a class (Rifleman, Special Ops or Sniper). Classes’ equipment and skills can be upgraded with the experience points earned in combat.</p>",

In this third-person action-adventure game, you are Star-Lord, and thanks to your bold yet questionable leadership, you have persuaded an oddball crew of unlikely heroes to join you. Some jerk (surely not you) has set off a chain of catastrophic events, and only you can hold the unpredictable Guardians together long enough to fight off total interplanetary meltdown. Use Element Blasters, tag-team beat downs, jet boot-powered dropkicks, nothing’s off-limits. If you think it’s all going to plan, you’re in for a world of surprises, with the consequences of your actions guaranteed to keep the Guardians on their toes. In this original Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy story, you’ll cross paths with powerful new beings and unique takes on iconic characters, all caught in a struggle for the galaxy’s fate. It’s time to show the universe what you’re made of. You got this. Probably.</p>",

By the time the game begins, Peter has captured the infamous Kingpin as well as several other supervillains. Now, a gang that goes by the name of Demons poses a new danger to New York. Meanwhile, Peter is working for the scientist Otto Octavius, who didn&#39;t yet become Dr. Octopus, on their science project. Throughout the game, Spidey has to deal with multiple enemies, such as Norman Osbourne, Electro, Vulture, Rhino and Kingpin, among others.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, from the third person view. There are also sections of the game in which the player controls other protagonists, namely Mary Jane and Miles Morales. The game is set in a 3D environment that is modeled after New York City. The player can travel the city using web slings, running, jumping, and crawling the walls. The setting includes numerous high-rise buildings designed specifically for Spider-Man&#39;s movements.</p>\n<p>As the player progresses, he or she unlocks new suits that grant Spider-Man new abilities, such as additional attacks or enhanced Spider-Sense. The abilities are not tied to the suits, however, and the player can use the suit of his or her choice without losing the ability. The combat system is similar to that in Batman: Arkham, in that Spider-Man fights many opponents in hand-to-hand combat but avoids killing them.</p>",

Joker wants to poison the whole city with his laughing gas. Batman and Robin have to disrupt the villains’ plans.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is divided into the heroes’ and villains’ missions. In the heroes’ missions, you play as Batman or his aides Robin, Batgirl, and Nightwing, while the playable villains change over the course of the game.

Each character has his or her unique abilities, such as special weapons, double jumps, mind control or immunity to certain attacks. The player can also change the suits of the characters to use their specific effects.

Like with all LEGO games, its visual style imitates a world that is entirely made of LEGO constructions and inhabited by mini-figures.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game follows the plot of the movies rather than the original book. LEGO The Hobbit recreates The Hobbit story using voice samples from the movies, while also parodying it with the addition of the tongue-in-cheek humor. The plot takes place in the high fantasy world of Middle-Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the main protagonist, is a hobbit. He lived a peaceful life until one day a company of thirteen dwarves and the wizard named Gandalf called him to join them on an adventure. Bilbo and his new friends left out on a quest to reconquer the dwarves&#39; home, the Lonely Mountain, and its treasures from the wicked dragon Smaug. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls the Thorin&#39;s party, switching between characters when needed. Each character has his unique abilities, such as climbing or shooting arrows. The game is divided into a series of short, linear levels that correspond to certain scenes in the movies. On the way, the player has to smash objects made of LEGO and sometimes use them to assemble new objects. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer for two.</p>",

Archaeologists find an artifact, a mysterious box, in ruins on the ocean floor, in the early 21st century. They can not determine what it is and put a find in one of the museums in New York, where it is well guarded.</p>\n<p>However, there is a person in the world who knows exactly what it is. This is the millionaire Ormond LeFey. LeFey hires an experienced thief Charles Deckard. Deckard must enter the museum, open this artifact and take its contents.</p>\n<h3>Pawn in someone else&#39;s game</h3>\n<p>Deckard easily bypasses the security system of the museum and opens the box. When he does this, Signet appears on his left hand, and a powerful cloud of energy rips out of the box into the sky.</p>\n<p>Deckard leaves the museum and sees that there are creatures running around the streets, which were known only from myths. The sky is also full of these creatures, and all of them, both in heaven and on earth, attack people, tear them apart, turn over cars and destroy buildings.</p>\n<h3>From Pawn to Queen</h3>\n<p>Deckard is the only person capable of removing monsters from our world. Deckard has to fight monsters with conventional weapons, but Signet on his arm absorbs the energy of dead monsters, this energy is able to heal Deckard and give him the power to &quot;kinetic strike&quot;. Some useful things also do not work unless you apply this energy to them.<br />\nDeckard has a notebook containing information about his tasks, monsters and weapons.<br />\nDuring the game, Deckard has to go to London, then again return to New York, to penetrate the headquarters of LaFay, to cope with many other missions.</p>\n<h3>Allies and multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Deckard is assisted by members of the paramilitary organization &quot;Council of 98&quot;, this organization also knows about the artifact. The millionaire LeFay, who hired Deckard to open the artifact, is also not the loner, but the head of another organization, the Black Order, which seeks to master the forces of the artifact to conquer the world.<br />\nWhen playing in multiplayer mode, up to eight people can participate in the game, and the Council of 98 and the Black Order are very relevant there.</p>",

Upon the Prince&#39;s arrival, the kingdom is found to be under a siege. Trying to repel the invaders, Malik uses an ancient mystic medallion that frees the ancient army of Solomon.

The player is able to control all four nature elements: fire, earth, water, and air. Using such power, it is easy to manipulate the game&#39;s environment.

If the player makes a mistake and the Prince dies, the player can travel several seconds back into the gameplay. If such a thing is impossible, the player has to restart from the latest checkpoint.</p>",

This time the player controls Lynch - a psychopath who now lives in Hong-Kong with his love Xiu. Kane, the protagonist of the first game, comes to Hong-Kong in hopes to get some money by smuggling guns to Africa together with Lynch, but at the very beginning of the game Lynch decides to do a little job with local mafia and Kane accidentally shoots a girlfriend of influential mafia person and everyone, starting with local hooligans, police and then military turns against the two. <br />\nKane &amp; Lynch: Dog Days differs from all the other third person shooters by its original visual style and presentation. Everything what player sees is filtered by lo-fi visual effects and so everything looks like filmed with an old and cheap digital photo camera. The screen is shaking all the time, censuring wounds of shot enemies, colors of screen drastically changes when Lynch is wounded. The rhythm of the game is insanely quick to the point where it gets surreal.</p>",

An armada of Fourth Reich ships, built in secret at a hidden base on the moon, descends upon the Earth to rain terror and destruction.<br/>But this is not done without resistance. A cadre of crack space pilots have stepped forth to defend Mother Earth from becoming the new Fatherland of this twisted regime. A lone pilot, entering the hangar to see three state-of-the-art, prototypes ships awaiting him, knows he is the only one who can save Planet Earth. It is up to him and his brothers in arms to ensure that humanity stays free of the yolk of Nazism for good and all...<br/><br/>Set during the main conflict of the movie, “Iron Sky: Invasion” puts players in the cockpit of an advanced new starfighter, to test his or her might, flight and dogfighting skills against the forthcoming Blitzkrieg-on-high. The main objectives are to defend Earth and its space installations from enemy attacks, blast as many Nazi ships into oblivion as humanly possible, collect and skillfully manage necessary resources, and make it alive to the final confrontation… where the ultimate secret weapon of the Fourth Reich awaits those foolishly brave enough to take up the hammer and chisel of heroism and attempt to carve their names onto the tablets of history.GameplayThe film itself was only the first stage of the assault. Now, after the credits have rolled, the true strike begins with “Iron Sky: Invasion”, the official video game of the movie. The game puts the players in direct control of an advanced space fighter pilot hell-bent on protecting Earth from an invading Nazi fleet from outer space.<br/>Created by the architects of the world’s most popular European RTS series, the “Earth” franchise (“Earth 2140”, “Earth 2150” &amp; “Earth 2160”), and the best-selling RPG hits “Two Worlds” and “Two Worlds II”, “Iron Sky: Invasion” packs more firepower than a space-borne missile array, and, as did the film, will supersede the expectations of its genre.

Instead, with the help of fellow captive<br />\nYinsen, Tony built his own ultimate weapon – a powerful suit of armor<br />\nthat served as the key to his heroic escape.</p>\n<p>After returning home, Tony’s near-death experience drastically altered<br />\nhis outlook on life. The attack against Tony – with his own creations,<br />\nno less – inspired him to cease production of all Stark Industries<br />\nweapons, despite the protests of longtime family</p>\n<p>friend and mentor Obadiah Stane. And that wasn’t all. Aided by his<br />\ncharming assistant, Pepper Potts, and equipped with a new suit even more<br />\nadvanced than the one used in his escape, Tony took it upon himself to<br />\ndestroy all Stark weapons in enemy hands – personally. He became more<br />\nthan a man. He became Iron Man.</p>\n<p>&quot;</p>\n<p>Become a one man army as the unstoppable Iron Man! Customize your suit<br />\nand battle against armies of fighter jets, tanks, armored Super Villains<br />\nand more. Blast into hardcore shooting action and explosive combat from<br />\nthe film as well as exclusive content created just for the game.</p>",

The gameplay is made in a traditional fighting 2.5D manner: battles occur in a 2D perspective but all the characters and objects are 3D. All fights are held in one-on-one form, where each participant has two life scales. Game mechanics are simple: three different types of hits and a special ability are available for each character. Some on-map objects are interactive and can be also used in attack. The main action takes place in a universe, which is parallel to a DC’s one, so occasionally clashes may look unusual. According to the storyline, Superman established dictatorship on Earth, and several Justice League members started resisting him. In the game, players are able to take control of favourite DC heroes and to participate in a war between Superman’s domination and the rebellion led by Batman. The Ultimate Edition offers players 6 new characters, over 30 new skins, and 60 new S.T.A.R. Labs missions. <br />\nInjustice: Gods Among Us is followed by the sequel Injustice 2.</p>",

Fingerprints of this are clear: the crafting mode essential to the original has been added to the game, and the title has become more friendly all in all. That is the contrast with the previous TellTale installments — they were mainly targeting mature audience. </p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>The Story Mode created the narrative from the start — the original game does not feature it. The story centers around Jesse — the protagonist and the player at the same time — who travel around the in-game world in searches for The Order of the Stone.</p>",

Nations hire private military corporations instead of having their own armies. The  War Economy emerges with the Sons Of the Patriots system controlling the PMCs. Soldiers are infused with nanomachines that control their behavior on the battlefield, and the weapons are ID-locked. Liquid Ocelot sets out to hijack the system to use in his own interests. Solid Snake grows old rapidly and gets ready for his last mission in order to kill Liquid and save the world once again.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Snake is proficient in Close quarters combat and stealth infiltration. Players are deployed on the battlefield with a wide arrange of gadgets at their disposal, such as the OctoCamo that allows for replicating any surface the player is close to or a Solid Eye that serves as the game&#39;s HUD. It is essential to keep an eye on Snake&#39;s stress level. As the protagonist&#39;s stress level increases, it gets harder to aim, Snake suffers more damage, and it is easier to get knocked out in hand-to-hand combat.</p>\n<p>A VR mode is also present in the game where players can learn about the weapons they can use and master the CQC.</p>",

Another new feature is that the player can choose the prize car he or she receives.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s also a new option called Autovista.

This part of the series has street racing as its main theme. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game includes 34 cars divided by three types: &quot;derby&quot;, &quot;race&quot; and &quot;street&quot;. As the player&#39;s career progresses, he or she can unlock more cars that include everything up to school buses. Each car has its unique characteristics and may require different driving styles. The player can also upgrade his or her existing vehicle instead of purchasing a new one.</p>\n<p>In the career mode, the game includes more than 30 tracks with varied environment and length. The levels often allow more than one route to choose from at any lap. AI-controlled opponents have personalities that define their driving style. Besides the races, there are mini-games that offer the player to perform stunts.</p>\n<h3>Differences from the original game</h3>\n<p>Compared to the first part, the sequel doubled on the number of available cars, tracks, and mini-games. FlatOut 2 also introduced longer tournaments and online multiplayer. There&#39;s also an improved physics engine. The tire grip was enhanced, making the controls more sturdy, and the cars are now less likely to bounce off the track.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s also a ragdoll physics model that defines the movements of the driver within the car. After crashes and during the stunt mini-games the driver may even fly out of the car. In some mini-games, the goal is to throw the driver&#39;s body as far as possible or to land it on a designated target.</p>",

While in captivity, the boy’s first task is to befriends his cellmate, a fantasy creature named Trico, who is a gigantic half-bird, half-cat hybrid that slightly reminds a hippogriff. Trico is the second main character and the mascot of The Last Guardian; the creature’s animation is incredibly detailed, and its behavior is modeled after real animals. The two form an unlikely symbiosis. The boy needs the creature’s strength and ability to fly to overcome obstacles and fend off guards who try to bring the characters back to their cells. Trico, in turn, needs the boy’s wits and agility to sneak, solve puzzles, feed the creature and heal its wounds. The player only controls the boy, while Trico needs to be manipulated into performing certain actions. Over time, the characters develop a strong emotional bond that adds to the game’s impact on the player.</p>",

Tanner is chasing the mobster Charles Jericho who survived the events of Driver 3. </p>\n<p>While awaiting trial in San Francisco, Jericho escapes the custody and wrecks chaos in the city. Tanner is injured and falls into a coma. While unconscious, the protagonist discovers he has a supernatural power to inhabit other people&#39;s bodies. It allows him to continue the chase.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a thoroughly modeled San Francisco complete with its famous landmarks. Unlike in the three previous games, Tanner cannot leave the car and walk around. Instead, Driver: San Francisco introduces a new option called Shift, using which the protagonist instantly changes vehicles. This is explained as a supernatural ability to switch bodies. </p>\n<p>The game also reintroduces the popular Film Director mode. It allows the player to replay his or her adventures using various cameras so that the walkthrough video looks almost like a movie.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game is the first in the series to introduce both local and online multiplayer. There are several modes that include a vehicular tag game and other variations of a competitive chase game.</p>",

There are also boosters on the track, such as Nitro or Autopilot. The game features a grappling hook from LittleBigPlanet 2, which is used to pass obstacles during the race. It is also possible to hit a rival with it if they are close enough.</p>\n<p>Unlike most racing games, LittleBigPlanet Karting puts a heavy emphasis on the number of game modes: Battle Mode, Waypoint Races, Treasure Hunts, Score Attacks and much more modes are available to the players.</p>\n<p>Like in the other LittleBigPlanet games, the community-made content plays a vital role in the game&#39;s philosophy, which is described as “Play, create, share.” The players can customize their characters, edit the tracks or create their own maps from the ground up.

Over the course of the game, Hawke eventually rises to power and influences the fate of the whole Thedas.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main protagonist is fully customizable. The player can choose his or her first name, gender, appearance and character class. There are three classes available: mage, warrior, and rogue. The player controls not only Hawke but also his or her party that can include up to three companions at once. You can only control one character at a time, however, switching between them while leaving the rest to AI control. </p>\n<p>Dragon Age II introduced the dialogue wheel that was borrowed from the Mass Effect series.

      "descripcion": "<p>Dishonored is the game about stealth. Or action and killing people. It is you who will decide what to do with your enemies. You play as Corvo Attano, Empress&#39; bodyguard, a masterful assassin and a combat specialist. All of a sudden, a group of assassins kill the Empress and kidnaps her daughter Emily. Being accused of murder and waiting for execution in a cell, Corvo still manages to escape with the help of the Loyalists and their leader Admiral Havelock. Now it is your duty to return the Empress daughter and restore your name. The main focus of the game is to give the player a choice. You can spare the lives of your enemies by knocking them out or making others do the job for you or brutally murder everyone in the city. Gadgets are given by Piero Joplin, Loyalists engineer and by the Outsider, who gives Corvo magical abilities. The game reacts to your choices - grim atmosphere by itself can be turned even darker by killing people or slightly lighter by not doing so. It is only a player&#39;s choice what to do with his abilities. Basing on these actions the game will give you with two different endings of the story.</p>",

Instead of fancy stadiums, the game offers you to drive through snowy landscapes of Finland and dirty roads of London&#39;s suburbs. In the career mode, you need to compete with other racers to gain the interest of sponsors. The higher your rank becomes, the more cars become available.  <br />\nWhile DiRT 3 and the series in general is famous for its responsive controls and simple physics that make these games easy to master for newcomers, DiRT 3 features a quite challenging new mode - gymkhana. In this mode, you need to perform different tricks in a limited time period, such as drifting, jumping or spinning around. Gymkhana rounds are unskippable to progress in the career mode. Another key feature that highlights DiRT 3 is flashbacks - the mechanics that allows turning back time if you made a mistake during the race and driving a certain piece of the track again.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>DMC: Devil May Cry is a hack-and-slash adventure game, the fifth installment in Capcom’s Devil May Cry franchise and reboot of the series. This is the first game in the series not developed by Capcom, but rather by English studio Team Ninja. Concerning story, the game is connected to the previous game and changes the cast of characters and even Dante’s (the series main protagonist) iconic appearance (which was met with indignation from the series fans at the time). The game’s story is notable for its social commentary regarding mass-media and modern capitalism drawbacks.  <br />\nThe gameplay overall is very similar to the other installments of the Devil May Cry series and is heavily focused on fast-paced fighting with hordes of demons with occasional puzzles and platforming sections. The main change in the game’s combat mechanics is the Angel and Devil modes. They alternate Dante’s and attacks and special abilities. The modes are activated by holding left or right trigger (on the controller) which makes switching between them instant and allows performing complex combos, combining each mode’s unique features.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Far Cry 4 is a first-person shooter, which inherits traditions of the original Far Cry franchise. However, the plot of the fourth chapter is unique and has no direct references to the previous games of the series. The story is now set in the Far East, where the new main character Ajay Gale joins the opposition fighting the dictatorship. The open world lets players explore the entire environment of Kyrat – a tiny fictional region hidden in towering Himalayas. Ajay as a Kyrati-American travels to Kyrat to scatter the ashes of his mother in her motherland, but suddenly things go the wrong way, and he finds himself in the middle of the civil war between the powerful dictator Pagan Min and rebels from the Golden Path founded by his father. As the story progresses, players get new weaponry and equipment or customize the ones they have. From the very beginning, the whole map is not available, so to progress and to complete the story players have to open all the game areas by “activating” bell towers (traditional Far Cry mechanic) for establishing the Golden Path’s radio propaganda and defeating enemies’ fortresses.</p>",

Only weapons Isaac has access to are his engineer tools, which can all be upgraded with the limited supplies. Dead Space introduces a new variant of zombies called Necromorphs, that are highly mobile and instead of aiming for the head, players will be asked to attack the limbs, in order to incapacitate and slow them down, eventually killing them.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>Dante&#39;s Inferno is a slasher role-playing game developed by Visceral game.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is loosely based on the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The players control Dante, a veteran of crusades, looks for his beloved Beatrice who got taken by Lucifer. As Dante descends deeper into Hell, he has to face more and more horrific creatures, his own sins and the dark history of his family.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Dante&#39;s Inferno is similar to most slayer games. The core mechanics of the genre are to control a character who traverses different locations and eliminates every enemy they find on their path (demons in this case). The protagonist&#39;s weapons are long-ranged, allowing for the mass murder of their enemies. </p>\n<p>The boss battles in the game are heavily inspired by God of War, where the player firstly fights with the boss and later uses a quick-time event to finish their enemy off. </p>\n<p>Multiple platforming puzzles are present in the game. The levels itself consist of multiple interconnected platforms. There are numerous spots where the players have to jump to, not without using their weapons on several occasions. </p>\n<p>Two weapons are present in the game: the Death&#39;s Scythe and a Holy Cross, which differ both in their usage and their role in the game&#39;s character progression system. Both weapons have their own upgrade trees which require souls. Souls can be acquired by killing enemies with one of the weapons.</p>",

Prophet, the squad leader from Crysis, also makes an appearance, and his recorded memories guide Alcatraz as he uncovers the alien plot. As in every game of the series, the protagonist is armed with a futuristic Nano Muscle Suit, a military exoskeleton that adsorbs damage, heals and strengthens the wearer. The suits were updated since Crysis, introducing modules for suit customization and a new Tactical mode. The player can now use multiple suit modes at the same time. <br />\nMost levels are set in the urban environment this time to distinguish the game from the original. Alcatraz is eventually tasked with defending New York from the alien invasion, and the battle ensues at iconic places like Times Square.

The main task is to eliminate three criminal bosses and organized crime syndicates: Los Muertos, The Volk and Shai-Gen Corporation. In order to get to the very top and overthrow every villain, the player will have to travel around the city and defeat the first level of the criminal hierarchy: thieves and bandits. Each gang is assigned its own district - so capturing an offender in one area leads to the next level in the hierarchy of one of the gangs. Having defeated the kingpins the player can challenge the head of the criminal organization.</p>\n<h3>Game mechanics</h3>\n<p>The game is typical for the third-person-action set in a sandbox environment, like the games of the Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row series.

There are many mechanics that aim to make the marksmanship realistic. Each bullet’s trajectory strongly depends on the wind and distance to the target. There’s a HUD that displays the intensity and direction of the wind, allowing the player to aim better. A red dot indicates where the bullet will hit, though this can be disabled in a higher difficulty level. The character’s physical state also influences his accuracy, and after running, he has to rest for a while before shooting. Stealth is also a vital component of the gameplay.

After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart.

For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.</p>\n<p>The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.</p>\n<p>Portal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.</p>",

There are three game modes: the story campaign, multiplayer and Spec Ops. </p>\n<p>If there are almost no changes in the campaign, and this is the same linear story, the Spec Ops includes 23 new levels for single or cooperative completion. Each level is a new task, a new challenge whether it is the defusing a bomb or the elimination of enemy forces. Levels are divided into tiers by their complexity.</p>\n<p>As in any other game of the series, the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 takes a special place. Each match is a mission, for which you need to come up with new strategies to complete. As in the past, new weapons and perks are opened for the execution of tasks.</p>",

Brink allows you to seamlessly move between your single player campaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively.<br />\nPlay SMART – Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you’re used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and adds a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether you’re a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, you’ll be able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action with SMART.<br />\nContext-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications, missions, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your condition, your location, your squad-mates, and the overall status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You’ll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success.</p>",

The story tells about the formation of Hyperion Corporation and the fate of its head - Handsome Jack, whom we meet while in the role of a simple programmer who dreams to find some valuable artifact. In the game there are various innovations - in the plot, in the characters, in the scenarios of missions and in the setting. For example, on the Pandora satellite, gravity is much weaker, but there is no oxygen at all. Therefore, the task of obtaining oxygen becomes very important for everyone. Moreover, oxygen is needed not only for breathing, but also for the functioning of personal jetpacks and long high jumps. In the game there is another additional story and downloadable content, including new characters and story campaigns.</p>",

He is voiced by Mike Patton, the vocalist of Faith No More.</p>\n<p>Despite his heroic deeds, Spencer was framed for crimes he was not guilty of and sentenced to be executed. The government releases the protagonist after a terrorist attack that destroys the whole Ascension City. Spencer has to clear his name and earn his freedom by finding and defeating the perpetrators of the attack, the BioReign organization.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Nathan from the third person view. Unlike the original Bionic Commando, the sequel is in 3D.

But one madman from Tokyo began to produce robots that do not know that they are robots - and this can be understood because they look and behave exactly like people. This is a violation of the law, and the team of pros from different countries flies to Japan to forever stop the conveyor of the insane inventor. Robots with problems of self-identification can provide a variety for those fans of tactical shooters who are tired of terrorists and zombies.<br />\nThe game has visually attractive features. The style of opponents, the style of equipping the team of heroes are very attractive and original. Some details of the battles are well presented - bullets knock out picturesque clouds of debris. Locations are less expressive - apparently, so as not to interfere with focusing on the actual combat. A notable feature of the gameplay is the dependence of the relationship in the team on the player&#39;s actions. If the team has bad mutual support - lower trust, lower trust - lower effectiveness in combat.</p>",

      "descripcion": "<p>The sequel to Battlefield: Bad Company is the ninth game in the Battlefield series overall. The plot is set in an alternate history timeline, in which there&#39;s an ongoing war between the United States and Russia; and the Russians are winning. They have already conquered most of Eurasia and made Latin American Countries their allies. The protagonist is a member of Bravo-2 spec ops squad. He is tasked with eliminating colonel Arkady Kirilenko, the leader of a secret project that is about to produce a Russian superweapon that can be used to defeat the US once and for all. The rest of Bravo-2 is computer-controlled. The NPC will assist the player and are technically immortal; however, they cannot complete missions without player&#39;s actions.<br />\nWhile most of the time you play as infantry, there are certain stages where players can drive tanks, helicopters, gun turrets and other vehicles. One of the most distinctive features of the game&#39;s Frostbite engine is that all elements of the environment are fully destructible. Besides plot-driven single-player campaign, there&#39;s also multiplayer that allows five different modes. All characters are divided into four classes: Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon. Medics, in particular, can speed up the health regeneration; however, lost hit points are slowly restored by themselves.</p>",

The environment of the game plays a big part in the gameplay as the player can pick up any object and use it as a melee weapon. Such objects can also be used to break doors or get unreachable items.</p>\n<p>The game also features a realistic fire model, so some items can be lit up in the fire. A crafting system is also present in the game. For example, the medical spray can be used to treat wounds, but if combined with a lighter, it becomes a flamethrower.</p>",

It doesn&#39;t stop her from descending again into the grotesque realm of disturbing visuals, creepy music, and absurdist logic.

On her way, Alice will jump the platforms, solve puzzles, and fight enemies. The combat system allows for a seamless flow of attacks, dodges, and combos. Besides her trademark Vorpal Blade, Alice will use other, somewhat surreal weapons, such as Teapot Cannon, Clockwork Bomb, or Pepper Grinder.
